Pembrolizumab inhibits the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint and has antitumor activity in patients with ad -\\nvanced melanoma.\\nMethods\\nIn this randomized, controlled, phase 3 study, we assigned 834 patients with ad -\\nvanced melanoma in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks or four doses of ipilim -\\numab (at 3 mg per kilogram) every 3 weeks. Primary end points were progression-free and overall survival.\\nResults\\nThe estimated 6-month progression-free-survival rates were 47.3% for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 46.4% for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, and 26.5% for ipilimumab (hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.58; P<0.001 for both pembrolizumab regi -\\nmens versus ipilimumab; 95% confidence intervals [CIs], 0.46 to 0.72 and 0.47 to 0.72, respectively). Estimated 12-month survival rates were 74.1%, 68.4%, and 58.2%, respectively (hazard ratio for death for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.83; P = 0.0005; hazard ratio for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, \\n0.69; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.90; P = 0.0036). The response rate was improved with pem -\\nbrolizumab administered every 2 weeks (33.7%) and every 3 weeks (32.9%), as compared with ipilimumab (11.9%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Responses were ongoing in 89.4%, 96.7%, and 87.9% of patients, respectively, after a median follow-up of 7.9 months. Efficacy was similar in the two pembrolizumab groups. Rates of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 to 5 severity were lower in the pembrolizumab groups (13.3% and 10.1%) than in the ipilimumab group (19.9%).\\nConclusions\\nThe anti–PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab prolonged progression-free survival and over -\\nall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than did ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma.

In this international, random -\\nized, open-label phase 3 study of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab, called KEYNOTE-006, we com -\\npared PD-1 inhibition with CTLA-4 blockade in a controlled, randomized trial involving patients with advanced melanoma.Methods\\nPatients\\nPatients who were 18 years of age or older were eligible for enrollment if they had histologically confirmed, unresectable stage III or IV melano -\\nma and had received no more than one previous systemic therapy for advanced disease. Known BRAF V600 mutational status was required; previ -\\nous BRAF inhibitor therapy was not required for patients with normal lactate dehydrogenase lev -\\nels and no clinically significant tumor-related symptoms or evidence of rapidly progressive dis -\\nease. Other key eligibility criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) per -\\nformance status of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating greater disability) and provision of a tumor sample adequate for assess -\\ning PD-L1 expression. Excluded from the study were patients who had received previous therapy with CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 inhibitors and those who had ocular melanoma, active brain metasta -\\nses, or a history of serious autoimmune disease.\\nStudy Design and Treatment\\nPatients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight either every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks or four cycles of ipilimumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks. Random -\\nization was stratified according to ECOG perfor -\\nmance status (0 versus 1), line of therapy (first versus second), and PD-L1 expression (positive ver -\\nsus negative).\\nPembrolizumab was administered intravenously \\nduring a 30-minute period and continued until disease progression, the onset of unacceptable side effects, an investigator’s decision to discon -\\ntinue treatment, withdrawal of patient consent, or 24 months of therapy. Patients with confirmed complete response who received pembrolizumab for at least 6 months could discontinue therapy after receiving at least two doses beyond the de -\\ntermination of complete response. Ipilimumab was administered intravenously during a 90-min -\\nute period and continued for four cycles or until disease progression, the onset of unacceptable side effects, an investigator’s decision to discontinue treatment, or withdrawal of patient consent. After initial evidence of radiologic progression, patients whose condition was clinically stable could con -\\ntinue to receive study treatment until imaging \\nThe New England Journal of Medicine \\nDownloaded from nejm.org on February 11, 2019.

(Details regarding the management of treatment decisions are provided in the protocol, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.)\\nStudy Assessments\\nPD-L1 status was assessed in archival or newly obtained tumor samples by means of immuno -\\nhistochemical analysis with the use of the 22C3 antibody (Merck) at a central laboratory before randomization. Positivity was defined as mem -\\nbranous PD-L1 staining in at least 1% of tumor cells. Response was assessed at week 12 and ev -\\nery 6 weeks thereafter according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1,\\n18 on the basis of central radiologic \\nreview and immune-related response criteria19 by \\ninvestigator review. RECIST was used for the pri -\\nmary assessment of efficacy, whereas immune-related response criteria were used for managing treatment. Survival was assessed every 3 months after the discontinuation of a study drug. Adverse events, laboratory values, and vital signs were as -\\nsessed regularly and graded according to the Na -\\ntional Cancer Institute Common Terminology Cri -\\nteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.\\nEnd Points\\nPrimary end points were progression-free sur -\\nvival (defined as the time from randomization to documented disease progression according to RECIST or death from any cause) and overall sur -\\nvival (defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause). Secondary end points in -\\ncluded the objective response rate (defined as the percentage of patients with complete or partial response according to RECIST), the duration of response (defined as the time from the first doc -\\numented response to radiologic progression ac -\\ncording to RECIST), and safety. Efficacy was as -\\nsessed in the intention-to-treat population, with all patients included in the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned. Safety was assessed in the as-treated population, which was defined as all patients who underwent random -\\nization and who received at least one dose of a study drug.\\nStudy Oversight\\nThe original protocol and all amendments were approved by the relevant institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each study center. The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guide -\\nlines, and the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent.\\nKEYNOTE-006 was designed by representa -\\ntives of the study sponsor, Merck Sharp & Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck, and the academic advisors. An external data and safety monitoring commit -\\ntee oversaw the study. (Members of the commit -\\ntee are listed in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.) All data were collected by investigators and associated site personnel, ana -\\nlyzed by statisticians employed by the sponsor, and interpreted by the authors, including those from the sponsor. The corresponding and senior authors wrote the first draft of the manuscript. Assistance in manuscript preparation was pro -\\nvided by a science writer paid by the sponsor. All authors participated in reviewing and editing the manuscript, approved the submitted draft, had full access to the data used to write the manu -\\nscript and vouch for their accuracy, and attest that the study was conducted in accordance with the protocol.\\nStatistical Analysis\\nWe used the Kaplan–Meier method to calculate estimates of progression-free and overall surviv -\\nal. Data for patients who did not have disease progression or who were lost to follow-up were censored at the time of last tumor assessment for progression-free survival. Treatment differences for progression-free and overall survival were as -\\nsessed by means of the stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratios and associated 95% confidence in -\\ntervals were assessed with the use of a stratified Cox proportional-hazards model with Efron’s method of handling ties. We compared response rates in the study groups using the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method.\\nThe protocol specified the performance of \\ntwo interim analyses (as summarized in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The first analy -\\nsis was to be performed after at least 260 pa -\\ntients had disease progression or died in all study groups and all patients had been followed for at least 6 months.

Final overall survival analy -\\nsis will be performed after at least 435 deaths have occurred in all the study groups or when all pa -\\ntients have been followed for at least 21 months. All data presented here are from the first interim analysis, except those for overall survival, which are from the second interim analysis.\\nResults\\nPatients and Treatment\\nFrom September 18, 2013, to March 3, 2014, a total of 834 patients were enrolled in 16 coun -\\ntries; 279 were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 277 to receive pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, and 278 to receive ipilimumab (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Ap -\\npendix). The characteristics of the patients at baseline were well balanced across the study groups (\\nTable 1 , and Table S2 in the Supplemen -\\ntary Appendix). Among enrolled patients, 65.8% had received no previous systemic treatment for advanced melanoma, 68.7% had an ECOG per -\\nformance status of 0, 65.3% had stage M1c dis -\\nease (see Table S3 in the Supplementary Appen -\\ndix for characteristics of M1c disease), and 32.4% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. BRAF \\nV600 mutations were observed in 36.2% of pa -\\ntients, and of these, approximately 50% had re -\\nceived previous BRAF inhibitor treatment; 80.5% of patients had PD-L1–positive tissue samples. The median duration of follow-up at the time of data cutoff was 7.9 months (range, 6.1 to 11.5).\\nPrimary End Points\\nProgression-free Survival\\nOn the basis of 502 events that were analyzed at the protocol-specified time point for the first in -\\nterim analysis, the two pembrolizumab regimens significantly prolonged progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. The estimat -\\ned 6-month progression-free survival rates were 47.3% for patients receiving pembrolizumab ev -\\nery 2 weeks, 46.4% for those receiving pembro -\\nlizumab every 3 weeks, and 26.5% for those re -\\nceiving ipilimumab (Fig. 1A). Median estimates of progression-free survival were 5.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.4 to 6.9), 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 6.9), and 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 2.9), respectively. The hazard ratios for disease progression for pembrolizumab versus ipilim -\\numab were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.72; P<0.001) for the 2-week regimen and 0.58 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.72; P<0.001) for the 3-week regimen. The ben -\\nefit for progression-free survival was evident in all prespecified subgroups for the two pembroli -\\nzumab groups (Fig. 2A). The benefit of pembro -\\nlizumab over ipilimumab was observed in both PD-L1–positive and PD-L1–negative subgroups, as compared with ipilimumab.\\nOverall Survival\\nAt the time of data cutoff for the second interim analysis, which was driven by a minimum follow-up duration of 12 months for all patients, 289 deaths had occurred. One-year estimates of sur -\\nvival were 74.1% for patients receiving pembro -\\nlizumab every 2 weeks (hazard ratio for death as compared with the ipilimumab group, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.83; P<0.0005), 68.4% for those re -\\nceiving pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (hazard ratio for death as compared with the ipilimumab group, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.90; P = 0.0036), and \\n58.2% for those receiving ipilimumab (Fig. 1B). Because the overall survival results for the two pembrolizumab groups were superior to those for the ipilimumab group at the prespecified one-sided alpha level of 0.005 using the Hoch -\\nberg step-up procedure, the independent data and safety monitoring committee recommended stopping the study early to allow patients in the ipilimumab group the option of receiving pem -\\nbrolizumab. Median overall survival was not reached in any study group. The pembrolizumab benefit was observed across all subgroups and for the two regimens (Fig. 2B). The exception was for the 18% of patients with PD-L1–negative tumors, for whom the hazard ratios were 0.91 for those receiving pembrolizumab every 2 weeks and 1.02 for those receiving pembrolizumab ev -\\nery 3 weeks, as compared with ipilimumab.

Rates of complete response were 5.0%, 6.1%, and 1.4%, respectively. The median times to response were 86 days (range, 32 to 212), 85 days (range, 36 to 251), and 87 days (range, 80 to 250), respectively; and 89.4%, 96.7%, and 87.9% of responses, respectively, were ongoing at the time of this analysis, with the median duration of response not reached in any group (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The evaluation of the maximum change in tumor size that was conducted at the time of the first interim analysis supports the superiority of the two pembrolizumab regimens over ipilimumab (Fig. 3).\\nAdverse Events\\nThe mean duration of exposure was 164 days among patients receiving pembrolizumab every  \\n2 weeks, 151 days among those receiving pem -\\nbrolizumab every 3 weeks, and 50 days for those receiving ipilimumab. Grade 3 to 5 adverse events that were attributed to a study drug by investiga -\\ntors occurred in 13.3%, 10.1%, and 19.9% of pa -\\ntients, respectively. The time until the onset of the first grade 3 to 5 adverse event, regardless of attribution, was longer in the pembrolizumab groups (Table S5 and Fig. S2 in the Supplemen -\\ntary Appendix). The rate of permanent discon -\\ntinuation of a study drug because of treatment-related adverse events was lower in each pembrolizumab group than in the ipilimumab group (4.0%, 6.9%, and 9.4%, respectively). One death in the ipilimumab group was attributed to study treatment. The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and died from cardiac arrest secondary to metabolic imbalances associated with ipilimumab-induced diarrhea.\\nThe most common treatment-related adverse \\nevents of any grade occurring in the pembroliz -\\numab groups were fatigue (20.9% in the 2-week group and 19.1% in the 3-week group), diarrhea (16.9% and 14.4%, respectively), rash (14.7% and 13.4%, respectively), and pruritus (14.4% and 14.1%, respectively) (\\nTable 2 , and Table S6 in the \\nSupplementary Appendix); all events were of grade 3 to 4 severity in less than 1% of patients, except diarrhea (2.5% and 1.1%, respectively). For ipilimumab, the most frequent adverse events were pruritus (25.4%), diarrhea (22.7%), fatigue (15.2%), and rash (14.5%); these events were of grade 3 to 5 severity in less than 1% of patients, except for diarrhea (3.1%) and fatigue (1.2%).\\nThe adverse events of special interest on the \\nbasis of the likely autoimmune or immune-relat -\\ned mechanism most frequently observed with pembrolizumab were hypothyroidism (10.1% in the 2-week group and 8.7% in the 3-week group) and hyperthyroidism (6.5% and 3.2%, respec -\\ntively) (\\nTable 2 ). Grade 3 to 4 events that were \\nreported in more than 1% of pembrolizumab-treated patients were colitis (1.4% and 2.5%, re -\\nspectively) and hepatitis (1.1% and 1.8%, respec -\\ntively). In the ipilimumab group, the most common adverse event of special interest was colitis, which occurred in 8.2% of patients. Grade 3 to 4 events that were reported in more than 1% of ipilimumab-treated patients were colitis (7.0%) and inflammation of the pituitary gland (i.e., hy -\\npophysitis) (1.6%). Hypothyroidism and hyperthy -\\nroidism were more frequent in the pembrolizumab groups, whereas colitis and hypophysitis were more frequent in the ipilimumab group.\\nDiscussion\\nIn this randomized, controlled, phase 3 study, we found that two regimens of pembrolizumab, as compared with ipilimumab, improved both pro -\\ngression-free and overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma. The relative risk of progres -\\nsion or death was decreased by 42% with the two pembrolizumab regimens that were tested, and the relative risk of death was decreased by 31 to 37%. Because the overall survival results at the second interim analysis crossed the prespecified Figure 3 (facing page).

For PD-L1 expression, the sample size was too small (less than 20% of patients) to draw a definite conclusion on relative efficacy. Several factors add complexity when interpreting correlative analyses of PD-L1 expression with efficacy.\\n21-23 For example, various levels of ex -\\npression can be found in different melanoma metastases originating from the same patients.\\n24 \\nFurthermore, additional variables, such as the presence of preexisting intratumoral CD8+  \\nT cells and tumor mutational load, may be im -\\nportant components to assess the potential for anti–PD-1 therapies.\\n25,26\\nThis study did not enroll patients with BRAF  \\nV600 mutations who did not receive previous anti-BRAF targeted therapy if they had high lac -\\ntate dehydrogenase levels and symptomatic or rapidly progressive disease, because targeted anti-BRAF agents can have a rapid clinical ben -\\nefit in this population of patients.\\n27 The treat -\\nment of patients with BRAF  V600 mutations and, \\nin particular, the most effective sequence of immunotherapy and BRAF or MEK inhibitors remains one of the most critical, yet unan -\\nswered, questions.

The primary outcome was death by 90 days after randomization.\\nRESULTS\\nA total of 3298 patients were enrolled; 1645 were randomly assigned to the pantoprazole group and 1653 to the placebo group. Data on the primary outcome were available for 3282 patients (99.5%). At 90 days, 510 patients (31.1%) in the pantoprazole group and 499 (30.4%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.13; P = 0.76). During the ICU stay, at least one clinically important event (a com\\n-\\nposite of clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, Clostridium difficile  \\ninfection, or myocardial ischemia) had occurred in 21.9% of patients assigned to panto -\\nprazole and 22.6% of those assigned to placebo (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.11). In the pantoprazole group, 2.5% of patients had clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, as compared with 4.2% in the placebo group. The number of patients with in\\n-\\nfections or serious adverse reactions and the percentage of days alive without life support within 90 days were similar in the two groups.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nAmong adult patients in the ICU who were at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, mortality at 90 days and the number of clinically important events were similar in those assigned to pantoprazole and those assigned to placebo.

We hypothesized that pantoprazole would be associated with a lower rate of gastrointesti -\\nnal bleeding but with higher rates of nosocomial infections and myocardial ischemia than placebo among these patients.\\nMethods\\nTrial Design and Oversight\\nWe performed screening and randomization be -\\ntween January 4, 2016, and October 22, 2017, in 33 ICUs in Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom after obtaining institutional approval at each site. We obtained written informed consent from the patients or their legal surrogates in accordance with national regulations. In most institutions, if the patient or legal guardian was unable to give consent initially, enrollment of patients was allowed on an emergency basis (e.g., with con -\\nsent from a doctor who was independent of the trial), followed by consent from relatives and the patient to continue participation. If consent was withdrawn or not granted, we asked the patient or surrogate for permission to continue registra -\\ntion of trial data and for permission to include these data in our analyses. The trial protocol and the statistical analysis plan have been pub -\\nlished elsewhere and are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\\n13,14 All the authors \\nvouch for the adherence of the trial to the pro -\\ntocol, the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses, and the reporting of adverse events. The members of the steering committee wrote the draft of the manuscript and made the final deci -\\nsion to submit it for publication. The trial was funded by Innovation Fund Denmark, which had no role in the design of the protocol, the trial conduct, or the analyses or reporting of the data. There was no commercial support for the trial.\\nThis trial was a multicenter, stratified, parallel-\\ngroup, placebo-controlled, blinded clinical trial. Randomization was performed with a centralized, computer-generated allocation sequence stratified according to trial site and the presence or ab -\\nsence of active hematologic cancer. Patients who were admitted to participating ICUs were screened and, if eligible, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with the use of permuted blocks of varying sizes, to receive pantoprazole or placebo. The trial-group assignments were concealed from the patients, clinicians, investigators, trial statisticians, and members of the data and safety monitoring committee. The data and safety monitoring com -\\nmittee oversaw the conduct of the trial and the safety of the participants. Interim analyses were planned to be conducted when 1675 and 2500 patients had been followed for 90 days. The lat -\\nter interim analysis was not performed, because the target number of patients enrolled was com -\\npleted before the 90-day follow-up of 2500 pa -\\ntients. The trial data were monitored at the sites by external monitors in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice directive of the European Union and centrally by staff from the coordinat -\\ning center.\\nParticipants\\nWe screened patients 18 years of age or older who were admitted to the ICU for an acute condi -\\ntion (i.e., excluding elective admissions) and had at least one risk factor for clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, including shock, use of anticoagulant agents, renal-replacement therapy, \\nThe New England Journal of Medicine \\nDownloaded from nejm.org at UCBL 1 - I-894 on December 11, 2018.

Patients were excluded if there were medical reasons, if they were receiving ongoing daily acid-suppressing therapy in the ICU, or if informed consent could not be obtained; 1001 patients met two or more exclusion criteria. A total of 52 patients were excluded immediately after randomization and before the first dose of trial agent because they did not meet the inclusion criteria or fulfilled one or more exclusion criteria; 7 patients were excluded after randomization because the patient or the surrogate did not allow the use of their data. The remaining 267 patients (130 in the pantoprazole group and 137 in the placebo group) who withdrew from the trial at their own or their surrogates’ request allowed the use of their data, but 20 patients or surrogates in the pantoprazole group and 20 in the placebo group did not want further data to be registered except for data on mortality, which we obtained from registries.

We also performed unadjusted chi-square testing for the binary outcome measures. We analyzed percentages of days alive without life support in the 90-day period with the van Elteren test (with adjustment for site only), because the assump -\\ntions for Poisson or negative binomial distribu -\\ntions were not met.\\n21 There was no adjustment for \\nmultiple comparisons of secondary outcomes, and the results are reported as point estimates with unadjusted 95% confidence intervals. There was no imputation for missing data (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 9 patients were lost to 90-day follow-up. We performed analyses using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and R software, version 3.4.3 (R Foundation), and considered a two-sided P value of less than 0.05 to indicate statistical signifi -\\ncance for the primary outcome with 95% con -\\nfidence intervals.\\nResults\\nTrial Population\\nFrom January 2016 through October 2017, a total of 3298 patients were enrolled in the trial; 1645 were randomly assigned to receive pantoprazole, and 1653 were assigned to receive placebo. We obtained data on 90-day vital status for 3282 patients (99.5%; 1642 in the pantoprazole group and 1640 in the placebo group) (Fig. 1). The \\ncharacteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two groups, with the exception of chronic lung disease, coagulopathy, and emer -\\ngency surgery (Table  1).\\nDuring the 90-day trial period, patients in each \\ngroup stayed in the ICU for a median of 6 days after randomization (interquartile range, 4 to 11 in each group), and patients in each group re -\\nceived the trial agent for a median of 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 9 in each group); 274 of 1644 patients (16.7%) in the pantoprazole group and 319 of 1647 (19.4%) in the placebo group discontinued the trial regimen in the ICU for reasons shown in Figure 1. The number of pa -\\ntients with major protocol violations was 46 (2.8%) in the pantoprazole group and 43 (2.6%) in the placebo group (Table S2 in the Supple -\\nmentary Appendix). On the first trial day, 58.2% of patients in the pantoprazole group and 56.4% in the placebo group received enteral feeding (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix); pa -\\ntients in each group received enteral feeding for a median of 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 10 in each group) in the ICU.\\nOutcomes\\nAt 90 days after randomization, 510 of 1642 pa -\\ntients (31.1%) in the pantoprazole group and 499 of 1640 (30.4%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.13; P = 0.76) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). The \\nresults were similar in the analysis with adjust -\\nment for baseline risk factors and in the per-protocol population (Tables S4, S5, and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). In predefined subgroup analyses, there was no heterogeneity in the ef -\\nfect of pantoprazole as compared with placebo on mortality at 90 days between patients with and patients without a history of liver disease, a his -\\ntory of or ongoing coagulopathy, shock, or me -\\nchanical ventilation, or between patients with different types of ICU admission (Fig. 2). We found heterogeneity in the estimate of the inter -\\nvention effect among patients with higher as compared with lower baseline severity of disease (defined as a SAPS II of >53 and ≤53, respec -\\ntively) (Fig. 2).\\nA total of 360 (21.9%) of 1644 patients in the \\npantoprazole group and 372 (22.6%) of 1647 in the placebo group had one or more clinically important events in the ICU (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.11 [not adjusted for multiple comparisons]) (Table 2). In the pantoprazole group, 41 patients (2.5%) had clinically impor -\\ntant gastrointestinal bleeding, as compared with 69 (4.2%) in the placebo group. The proportions of patients in each group with the other second -\\nary outcomes and with single components of the composite outcome were similar in the two groups and are shown in Table 2 without P values because of the lack of adjustment for multiple comparisons (also see Table S7 in the Supple -\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine \\nDownloaded from nejm.org at UCBL 1 - I-894 on December 11, 2018.

Details of the episodes of \\ngastrointestinal bleeding are provided in Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix.\\nDiscussion\\nIn this international, blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial involving adult patients in the ICU who were at risk for gastrointestinal bleed -\\ning, we found that 90-day mortality, percentages of days alive without the use of life support, and numbers of patients with clinically important events, infectious adverse events, or serious ad -\\nverse reactions were similar between those treated with pantoprazole and those who received pla -\\ncebo. Fewer patients in the pantoprazole group than in the placebo group had clinically impor -\\ntant gastrointestinal bleeding in the ICU, and the 95% confidence intervals (which were not ad -\\njusted for multiple comparisons) for the relative risk did not cross 1; however, the absence of correction for multiple comparisons of secondary outcomes limits inferences from this observation. The results of this trial apply only to patients who meet the entry criteria used in the trial, including a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.Our results are similar to those obtained in a \\nrecent network meta-analysis, in which no sig -\\nnificant differences were found in the rates of death or infectious complications between pa -\\ntients receiving placebo or no prophylaxis and those receiving proton-pump inhibitors; the latter group, however, did have lower rates of clini -\\ncally important gastrointestinal bleeding.\\n22 The \\nresults of the current trial did not reproduce those of observational studies, which have suggested an increased risk of infectious complications and myocardial ischemia in association with the use of proton-pump inhibitors.\\n10-12 We found no \\nsignificant differences between the pantoprazole group and the placebo group in the rates of these events in the full trial population, but we did find an interaction between the intervention effect and disease severity that suggested higher 90-day mortality among patients who had more severe disease and received pantoprazole. This may be a chance finding, but it warrants further study.\\nThe strengths of our trial include the large \\nsample size and variety of ICUs and countries involved, reflecting different practice patterns.

Secondary outcomes are presented without P values because of the lack of adjustment for multiple comparisons.\\n‡  Clinically important events included clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, and myocardial ischemia.\\n§  Infectious adverse events included pneumonia and C. difficile infection.\\n¶  Severe adverse reactions were defined as anaphylactic reactions, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, acute hepatic failure, the Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, interstitial nephritis, and angioedema related to the intervention (as judged by the treating clinicians and investigators).\\n14 Specific events that were adjudicated as not to being related to pantoprazole or placebo, including the reasoning behind \\neach adjudication, are described in Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix.\\n‖  The percentage of days alive without the use of life support was calculated as the number of days without the use of invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, infusion of vasopressor or inotropic agents, or any form of renal-replacement therapy, divided by the number of days alive within the 90-day follow-up period.Table 2.

Time to Death and Relative Risk \\nof Death at Day 90.\\nPanel A shows the survival curves with data censored \\nat day 90 for the two groups in the intention-to-treat population. The nine patients who were lost to 90-day follow-up — two patients in the pantoprazole group and seven patients in the placebo group — were included in the survival curves until the last day they were known to be alive; at that time point, data from these patients were censored. One patient in the pantoprazole group was known to be dead at day 90, but the date of death was unknown. This patient was excluded from the sur -\\nvival curves. Panel B shows relative risks with 95% con -\\nfidence intervals for the primary outcome measure of death at day 90 in the pantoprazole group as compared with the placebo group, among all the patients and  \\nin the six predefined subgroups, assessed by logistic-regression analysis with adjustment for the stratification variables. Shock was defined as at least one of the fol -\\nlowing: systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure of less than 70 mm Hg, use of vasopressors or inotropes (norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, vasopressin or dopamine, dobutamine, milrinone, or levosimendan), or a lactate level of more than 4 mmol per liter. Coagulopathy included both acute coagulopathy, defined as a platelet count of less than 50×10\\n9 per liter, an international normalized ratio of \\nmore than 1.5, or a prothrombin time of more than  20 seconds at ICU admission, and a history of coagu -\\nlopathy, defined as coagulopathy within 6 months be -\\nfore hospital admission. A history of liver disease was defined as portal hypertension; cirrhosis proved by biop -\\nsy, computed tomography, or ultrasonography; history of variceal bleeding; or hepatic encephalopathy in the medical history. A medical admission was defined as a hospital admission during which no surgery was per -\\nformed or an ICU admission in which surgery had been performed more than 1 week before admission. The Sim -\\nplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II was calculated from 17 baseline variables and ranges from 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating greater severity of disease. One or more variables were missing for 134 patients in the pantoprazole group and 115 patients in the placebo group for the calculation of the SAPS II; these patients were not included in the SAPS II subgroup analysis.\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine \\nDownloaded from nejm.org at UCBL 1 - I-894 on December 11, 2018.

      "[Document(page_content=\"Research Article\\nSerum 25(OH) Vitamin D and Risk of Breast Cancer:\\nA Nested Case-Control Study from the French E3N Cohort\\nPierre Engel1,2, Guy Fagherazzi1,2, Anne Boutten3, Thierry Dupré3, Sylvie Mesrine1,2,\\nMarie-Christine Boutron-Ruault1,2, and Françoise Clavel-Chapelon1,2\\nAbstract\\nBackground: High 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] serum concentrations have been found to be asso-\\nciated with reduced breast cancer risk. However, few studies have further investigated this relationship\\naccording to menopausal status, nor have they taken into account factors known to influence vitamin D sta-tus, such as dietary and serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, and estradiol serum levels.\\nMethods: We designed a nested case-control study within the French E3N cohort. Cases were women\\ndiagnosed with incident breast cancer ( n= 636). Controls ( n= 1,272) were matched with cases on age, meno-\\npausal status at blood collection, age at menopause, and center and year of blood collection. Multivariate\\nlogistic regression models were established.\\nResults: We found a decreased risk of breast cancer with increasing 25(OH) vitamin D\\n3serum concentra-\\ntions (odds ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.96; Ptrend = 0.02) among women in the highest tertile.\\nWe also observed a significant inverse association restricted to women under 53 years of age at blood sam-\\npling [odds ratio (T 3versus T 1), 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.98; Ptrend = 0.04].

The two\\nnaturally occurring vitamin D forms, ergocalciferol\\n(vitamin D 2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3), can be ob-tained from natural foods, fortified products, or sup-\\nplements, and vitamin D 3can be synthesized from\\n7-dehydrocholesterol in skin exposed to UVB radiation(3). After synthesis in the skin or oral intake, vitamin Dis converted into 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in the\\nliver. 25 Hydroxyvitamin D\\n3[25(OH)D3] is the predomi-\\nnant circulating metabolite and correlates with vitamin Dstatus (4). Then, 25(OH)D undergoes renal hydroxyla-\\ntion, tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH)\\nand calcium concentrations, into the vitamin D hormone\\ncalcitriol [1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; 1,25(OH)\\n2D], the\\nbiologically active metabolite. A lower proportion of\\n1,25(OH) 2D could also be locally synthesized in tissues,\\nincluding breast tissue, for local effects (5).\\nExperimental studies have shown that 25(OH)D (6),\\ncalcium (7), and PTH (8) might affect tumor deve-\\nlopment. High levels of 1,25(OH) 2D in the breast might\\nhave antitumor effects through the induction of cell dif-\\nferentiation, inhibition of cell growth, and regulation of\\napoptosis in normal and malignant cells, including hu-\\nman breast cells (9, 10). The actions of 1,25(OH) 2Da r e\\npredominantly mediated by activation of the vitamin D\\nreceptor (3), and plays a critical role in regulating intesti-\\nnal calcium absorption (11); 1,25(OH) 2D and extracellularAuthors' Affiliations:1Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche\\nMédicale U1018, Center for Research in Epidemiology and Population\\nHealth;2Université Paris-Sud, Villejuif Cedex, France; and3Biochemistry\\nLaboratory of Hospital Bichat, Assistance Publique des Hôpitaux\\nde Paris, Paris, France\\nNote: P.

All six\\nexisting case-control studies published thus far reported\\na significant inverse association between serum 25(OH)Dand breast cancer risk (14-19). Among six case-control\\nstudies nested in cohorts, only a recent study (20) found\\na statistically significant inverse association, whereas theothers failed to find any association (21-25). Studies\\nwhich analyzed data by menopausal status (14, 15, 17,\\n20-25) or age (19, 22) suggested that the effect of vitaminD on breast cancer is modulated by the hormonal milieu,\\na suggestion further supported by the recent finding of\\nan association between circulating 25(OH)D and steroidhormones in young women (26).\\nIn a case-control study nested in the French E3N\\n(Etude Epidémiologique auprès des femmes de l'Educa-tion Nationale) prospective cohort, we investigated therisk of breast cancer in women according to baseline 25\\n(OH)D3 serum concentrations as markers of vitamin D\\nstatus, taking into account serum calcium, PTH, and ste-roid hormone concentrations; we also analyzed breast\\ncancer risk according to age and menopausal status.\\nMaterials and Methods\\nStudy cohort\\nThe E3N cohort includes 98,995 French women born\\nbetween 1925 and 1950, and insured by a health in-\\nsurance plan mainly covering teachers. Participants,who gave written informed consent for external health\\nfollow-up through the health insurer, completed self-\\nadministered questionnaires, sent every 2 to 3 years sincebaseline in 1990, on medical and gynecologic history,\\nmenopausal status, and a variety of lifestyle characteris-\\ntics. In each questionnaire, participants were askedwhether a cancer had been diagnosed, and if so, patho-logy reports were requested from the attending physi-\\ncians. The study was approved by the French National\\nCommission for Data Protection and Privacy. The usualdiet was assessed through a validated 208-item dietary\\nhistory questionnaire sent out between June 1993 and\\nJune 1995 (27). Responders to the dietary questionnaireconstituted the French component of the European Pros-\\npective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study.\\nBlood samples were collected between 1995 and 1998among 24,505 E3N participants, aliquoted into plasma,serum, lymphocytes and erythrocytes, and stored in\\nliquid nitrogen (28). Along with blood samples, we col-\\nlected information on fasting status, smoking, body massindex (BMI), use of medication in the preceding 12 hours,\\nand menopausal status. Menopausal status at the date ofblood collection was also confirmed by information re-quested in each questionnaire until July 2005. We defined\\nthe date of menopause as the date preceding 12 consecu-tive months of amenorrhea (excluding hysterectomy), thedate of bilateral oophorectomy or, if not available (in de-\\ncreasing order of priority), the self-reported date of\\nmenopause, the date when menopausal hormone thera-py use began, the date when menopausal symptoms be-\\ngan, or an imputed date corresponding to age 47 if\\nmenopause was due to oophorectomy and age 51 other-wise (median ages for surgical and natural menopause in\\nthe cohort, respectively).\\nPopulation for analysis\\nFor this case-control study nested within the E3N co-\\nhort, we selected women who completed the dietary\\nquestionnaire and who had available information onage at blood collection, date of collection, center of collec-\\ntion, menopausal status at collection, and fasting status at\\ncollection. This left us with a subcohort of 17,540 subjectsamong whom, during a follow-up period of up to\\n10 years from blood collection until July 2005, we identi-\\nfied 636 cases of incident invasive breast cancer (58 inpremenopause and 578 in postmenopause). Two controls\\nper case ( n= 1,272) were selected (96 premenopause and\\n1,176 in postmenopause), matched on age (±2 years),\\nmenopausal status (premenopausal or postmenopausal)\\nat blood collection, age at menopause (±2 years), study\\ncenter (same among the 40 centers of collection), and dateof blood collection (same year).\\nAnalysis of 25(OH)D, calcium, PTH, estradiol, and\\nprogesterone serum concentrations\\nSerum samples were divided into batches of nine sam-\\nples corresponding to three cases and their matched con-\\ntrols in random order. Analyses were done by thebiochemistry laboratory of Bichat Hospital (Paris), which\\nwas blinded to the case-control status of the samples.\\nSerum from intact human 25(OH)D3, intact humanPTH 1-84, estradiol, and progesterone were measuredon an Elecsys Analyser (Roche Diagnostic) by chemilu-\\nminescence immunoassay. This method very specifically\\ndetermined 25(OH)D3, the predominant circulating me-tabolite in blood serum without interference by 25(OH)\\nD2, and which has been found to provide results similar\\nto those of the DiaSorin Liaison method (29), often usedin studies assessing serum 25(OH)D concentrations\\n(23, 25). Serum calcium was routinely determined on a\\nHitachi 911 Roche autoanalyzer. The optimal level ofvitamin D and the threshold below which a person could\\nbe viewed as being deficient remains controversial. Low\\nlevels of vitamin D led to a corresponding increase inPTH levels to maintain calcium homeostasis. Because athreshold of 30 ng/mL has been suggested as being nece-\\nssary to minimize deleterious health consequences in\\nterms of both bone health and other diseases (30),25(OH)D3 at <30 ng/mL was considered insufficient\\nand 20 ng/mL as deficient (3) in the present article.Engel et al.\\nCancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 19(9) September 2010 Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention 2342\\non August 1, 2017. © 2010 American Association for Cancer Research. cebp.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from \", metadata={'source': './articles\\\\2dff5573c7185251e19b4a301173e8f8bc85347c.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content=\"Statistical analysis\\nSeventy-five serum samples could not be used for any\\nbiological measurements either because samples were he-\\nmolyzed ( n= 7), the volumes were insufficient ( n= 45), or\\nthey could not be retrieved from the blood repository\\n(n= 23); thus, they were all placed in a separate category.\\nComparison of characteristics between cases and con-\\ntrols was done using χ2tests for categorical variables and\\nStudent's test for continuous variables. We also ran prin-\\ncipal component analyses and correlation tests to assessvariables associated with 25(OH)D3 serum concentra-\\ntions.

To evaluate\\nthe crude association, we created a first model, which in-cluded only matching covariates [i.e., age at blood collec-\\ntion, menopausal status, age at menopause, date (same\\nyear), and center of blood collection].\\nNext, as potential confounders, we included BMI at\\nblood collection (kg/m\\n2, continuous), use of menopausal\\nhormone therapy in postmenopausal women (current/past/never) at blood collection, and variables estimated\\nfrom the last questionnaire filled out before blood collec-\\ntion: personal history of mammography (yes/no), historyof breast benign disease (yes/no), family history of breastcancer (yes/no), number of children (0, 1, 2, 3+), smoking\\nstatus (never, past, current), use of oral contraceptives\\n(ever/never), age at menarche (year, continuous), andphysical activity [Metabolic Equivalent Task-Hour per\\nweek (METS-h/w), continuous].

For these two series of analyses, we created a first\\nmodel adjusted for age at blood collection, menopausal\\nstatus (only in the age-stratified analysis), age at meno-pause, and season of blood collection. To take into ac-\\ncount both latitude and sun exposure of each region atthe date of blood collection, we used mean daily UV doseexposure (continuous variables in kJ/m\\n2) in unconditio-\\nnal logistic regressions for parsimony of models, which\\nwas estimated among the 40 centers for blood collectionand the year of sampling using the UV mapping algo-\\nrithm (31).

This disparity between quar-tile cutoff points might be explained by sun exposure and\\nthe latitudes of the studies, but also by differences in vita-\\nmin D food fortification between Europe and the UnitedStates because the fortification of dairy foods and margar-\\nines has long been common in the United States (32),\\nwhereas it is restricted to very few products in France.\\nMore studies found an inverse association between\\n25(OH)D and breast cancer risk at premenopause [two(14, 20) out of five studies (14, 17, 20-22)] than at post-menopause [three, significant (15, 17) or not (22), out ofTable 3.

In addition,vitamin D inhibits the IGF-I –stimulated growth of breast\\ncancer cells (36). Because circulating levels of IGF-I and/\\nor IGF-binding protein 3 decline with age (37), the inter-action between IGF pathways and calcium and vitamin\\nD are likely to be stronger for younger women than for\\npostmenopausal women, possibly leading to higher riskreduction in young women (38). In addition, the elderly\\nhave been shown to have a decreased capacity for\\nvitamin D synthesis in the skin with similar sun exposure(39).

In our study, lower 25(OH)D3 serum concentrations have been found in over-\\nweight individuals, likely due to greater uptake of vita-\\nmin D into adipocytes rather than to less sun exposureor less effective vitamin D synthesis (42). However, BMI\\nwas not a confounder in the association between vita-\\nmin D and breast cancer risk, unlike findings from theWomen's Health Initiative, in which a lower risk ofbreast cancer associated with high baseline 25(OH)D\\nserum concentrations disappeared after adjustment\\nfor BMI (23). Nevertheless, the decreased bioavailabil-ity of vitamin D in tissues could explain the increased\\nrisk of cancer.\\nStrengths and limitations\\nOne strength of our results lies in the fact that we took\\ninto account both geographic localization and date of\\nblood collection as matching criteria, so that a latitude\\neffect or a potential seasonal effect was unlikely to have\\ninfluenced our results. Three ecological studies (43-45)showed a significant inverse association between UVBexposure and risk of breast cancer, while another found\\nno association (46). Although we did not record the\\nsunbathing habits of women in our study, we capturedsunlight exposure by specifically assessing the 25(OH)D3\\nserum concentration of both 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3instead (as is done in most studies), which reflects en-dogenous and exogenous vitamin D sources. Moreover,\\nno statistically significant correlation was found betweendietary vitamin D and serum vitamin D concentrationsin our study and added to evidence that assessment of\\nvitamin D serum concentration is a key observation to\\naccount for misclassification of exposure in studiesexamining dietary sources only.\\nAlthough we adjusted for a large number of major\\nparameters implicated either in vitamin D status or\\nbreast cancer incidence, our study had some limitations.\\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that the associations\\nwe observed resulted from a confounding bias. Casesand controls were from a selected population of highly\\neducated women willing to participate in both the die-\\ntary survey and blood collection. Although this popula-tion was not representative of the general population, it isnot clear how selection could have affected our results.\\nHowever, although information on menopausal status\\nwas accurate, premenopausal women did not provide in-formation on the menstrual phase cycle on the date of\\nblood collection; how this might have modified the as-\\nsociation between the 25(OH)D3 serum concentrationand breast cancer risk, specifically when adjusting for\\nboth serum estradiol and progesterone in this popula-\\nt i o n ,i su n k n o w n .N o n e t h e l e s s ,r e s u l t sw e r es i m i l a rwhether or not the model was adjusted for the two hor-\\nmonal biomarkers, which suggests only a weak effect of\\nthis missing information on our findings.

In particular,\\namong women taking vitamin D supplements, welacked information as to whether the supplement was\\nvitamin D2 or D3. Because we measured only 25(OH)\\nD3 serum concentrations, some misclassification of vi-tamin D concentrations might have occurred in women\\ntaking vitamin D\\n2. However, our findings were similar\\nwhen excluding vitamin D supplement users, thus sug-\\ngesting that this potential bias was of minor importance.It may also be questioned whether it is appropriate to\\nuse a single determination of 25(OH)D because vitamin\\nD status results from a combination of various lifestylecharacteristics which could change during the study\\n(sunbathing habits, exact sun exposure at the time of\\nblood collection, weather; ref. 47). We assessed 25(OH)D3 and other biomarker concentrations during an aver-\\nage of 4 years prior to breast cancer diagnosis. Nonethe-\\nless, it remains unclear as to which period is optimal formeasuring the vitamin D serum concentration, although\\nblood collection several years prior to breast cancer di-\\nagnosis is preferred (48). Interestingly, results from oursensitivity analyses indicated that the associations werestronger when excluding breast cancer cases diagnosed\\nduring the year following blood collection. In future\\nstudies, multiple measurements at different periodsbefore diagnosis may provide more accurate indicators\\nfor analysis.Engel et al.\\nCancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 19(9) September 2010 Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention 2348\\non August 1, 2017. © 2010 American Association for Cancer Research. cebp.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from \", metadata={'source': './articles\\\\2dff5573c7185251e19b4a301173e8f8bc85347c.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content=\"Conclusions\\nOur findings support the conclusion that the mainte-\\nnance of adequate vitamin D levels should be encour-\\naged, especially in populations with low 25(OH)Dserum concentrations, as in our study. To maintain a\\n25(OH)D serum concentration of >30 ng/mL, assuming\\na baseline of 10 ng/mL in sedentary women with very lit-tle sun exposure (49), an intake of 2,000 IU/d is necessary;\\nthis corresponds to the U.S. National Academy of\\nSciences' upper limit (50). However, recommendationsfrom food agencies concerning vitamin D intakes are be-\\ntween 200 and 400 IU/d, which is why scientists advocate\\nraising these recommendations (30, 51). Alternatively,12 minutes of sun exposure per day, on a clear day, with50% of the skin area exposed and if climate and season\\nallow, are equivalent to an approximate oral intake of\\n3,000 IU of vitamin D\\n3(52); however, these recommenda-\\ntions are not adapted to latitudes above 35 degrees, where\\nthere is minimal, if any, previtamin D 3production in the\\nskin during winter (52). These arguments support the ag-\\ngressive supplementation and fortification of foods such\\nas milk, dairy products, or orange juice in European\\ncountries, to be encouraged by food and health agencies.Further randomized intervention trials with differentdoses of vitamin D supplementation are also required to\\nconfirm its benefits on breast cancer risk.Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest\\nNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors are grateful to R.

Davies, James A. Gossage, Janine Zylstra, Fredrik Mattsson, Jesper Lagergren, Nick Maisey,  \\nElizabeth C. Smyth, David Cunningham, William H. Allum, et Robert C. Mason\\nRÉSUMÉ\\nObjectif \\nLa chimiothérapie néoadjuvante est une pratique reconnue dans la prise en charge de la plupart des \\nadénocarcinomes de l’œsophage et de la jonction œsogastrique résécables. Toutefois, évaluer les effets \\nde régression du stade tumoral de la chimiothérapie et prédire la réponse au traitement reste difficile, \\net l’importance relative du stade tumoral avant et après la chimiothérapie est contestable.\\nMéthodes\\nNous avons analysé des résections consécutives d’adénocarcinomes de l’œsophage et de la jonction \\nœsogastrique réalisées dans deux centres anti-cancéreux à fort recrutement de Londres entre l’an 2000 \\net 2010. Après les investigations habituelles et par consensus au sein de l’équipe multidisciplinaire, un \\nstade tumoral clinique a été attribué à tous les patients puis comparé au stade pathologique après \\nrésection chirurgicale. L’analyse de la survie a été réalisée en utilisant l’analyse de Kaplan-Meier et \\nl’analyse de régression de Cox.\\nRésultats\\nSur les 584 patients inclus dans  l’étude, 400 (68 %) ont reçu une chimiothérapie néoadjuvante. Les \\npatients ayant présenté une réponse à la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante ont bénéficié d’une survie \\nprolongée, comparé aux patients non répondeurs (p < 0,001), et une telle régression du stade tumoral (risque relatif [RR], 0,43 ; IC à 95 %, 0,31 à 0,59) était le facteur prédictif indépendant de la survie le \\nplus fort, après ajustement sur l’âge du patient, le grade de la tumeur, le stade tumoral clinique,  \\nl’envahissement lymphovasculaire, le statut des marges de résection et le type de résection chirurgicale. \\nLes patients en situation de downstaging sous chimiothérapie, comparés aux patients non répondeurs, \\nont présenté des taux plus bas de récidive locale (6 % vs  13 % ; p  = 0,030) ainsi que de récidive \\nsystémique (19 % vs  29 %, ; p = 0,027) et de meilleurs scores Mandard de régression de la tumeur  \\n(p < 0,001). La survie était fortement liée au  stade post-chimiothérapie néoadjuvante, plutôt qu’au stade \\nclinique initial.\\nConclusion\\nLe stade de l’adénocarcinome de l’œsophage et de la jonction œsogastrique après une chimiothérapie \\nnéoadjuvante détermine mieux le pronostic que le stade clinique avant la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante  ; \\ncela indique combien il est important de prendre en compte la stadification post-chimiothérapie pour \\nmieux prédire le devenir du patient et son éligibillité pour la chirurgie. Les patients répondeurs à la \\nchimiothérapie ont des taux réduits de récidive locale et systémique.\\nJ Clin Oncol 32:2983-2990. © 2014 par l’American Society of Clinical Oncology\\nINTRODUCTION\\nLa chimiothérapie préopératoire est un standard \\ndans le traitement de la majorité des patients atteints d’un cancer de l’œsophage résécable au Royaume-Uni, après qu’il a été démontré dans des essais cliniques randomisés contrôlés à grande échelle qu’elle apporte un bénéfice  de survie. \\n1-3 \\nLes bénéfices de la chimiothérapie préopératoire incluent une régression du stade de la tumeur primaire, une plus grande probabilité de résection chirurgicale complète  et le traitement des micro-métastases systémiques.\\n4,5 Si l’on admet qu’un \\ngrand pourcentage de cancers de l’œsophage nouvellement diagnostiqués présentent déjà une maladie métastatique occulte à la consultation initiale, il s’ensuit qu’une thérapie administrée par voie systémique pourrait constituer un facteur cru-cial  de  modification du pronostic à long terme, lorsqu’elle est associée à la chirurgie.\\n338_JCO-5_davies.indd   338 18/12/2014   10:31195.254.160.194Information downloaded from jco.ascopubs.org and provided by at Hospices Civils De Lyon on February 25, 2016 from\\nCopyright © 2014 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Dans deux des essais les plus récents, l’amé -\\nlioration absolue en termes de survie était de moins de 15 % et, par \\nconséquent, la plupart des patients n’a retiré aucun bénéfice d’une chimiothérapie optimale.\\n1,3 Pouvoir identifier ces patients représen-\\nterait une importante avancée clinique et pourrait éventuellement conduire à une prise en charge spécifique pour chaque patient.\\nNotre étude avait pour but d’évaluer le devenir à long terme \\nd’une population non sélectionnée de patients traités par chimio-thérapie préopératoire pour un adénocarcinome de l’œsophage. Notre principale hypothèse était que le stade tumoral après la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante serait un meilleur prédicteur de la survie que le stade tumoral à la présentation. Nous avions égale-ment l’intention d’évaluer dans quelle mesure les patients atteints d’un cancer de l’œsophage ou de la jonction œsogastrique chez qui la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante avait réussi à faire régresser la tumeur présentaient d’une plus longue survie, comparée aux patients dont le stade tumoral de la maladie n’avait pas régressé.\\nMÉTHODES\\nPatients\\nNous avons utilisé une base de données recueillies prospec-\\ntivement entre les années 2000 et 2010,  incluant 680 résections consécutives pour des tumeurs affectant l’œsophage et la jonction œsogastrique (type I ou II de Siewert\\n6). La base de données repré-\\nsente une collaboration entre deux établissements à fort recru-tement  pour le cancer de l’œsophage à Londres, Royaume-Uni (hôpital St. Thomas et hôpital Royal Marsden).\\nParmi les 96 patients exclus de cette cohorte se trouvaient 15 \\npatients qui avaient subi une intervention chirurgicale pour une maladie bénigne, un patient sans histologie et 80 patients atteints d’un cancer de l’œsophage  épidermoïde. Ainsi, la cohorte  finale comptait 584 patients atteints d’un adénocarcinome de l’œsophage et de la jonction œsogastrique. Sur ces 584 patients, 400 (68 %) ont reçu une chimiothérapie préopératoire, alors que les 184 autres (32\\n \\n%) ont subi une intervention chirurgicale uniquement.\\nStadification de la tumeur\\nTous les patients ont fait l’objet d’une discussion  multidiscipli-\\nnaire  ; ils ont ensuite bénéficié d’un protocole d’examens standard, parmi lesquels endoscopie, tomodensitométrie (CT), échographie endoscopique (EUS) et finalement tomographie par émission de positrons au fluorodésoxyglucose (FDG-PET). Le stade tumoral (cTNM) était évalué pour chaque patient avant de commencer la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante, de façon multidisciplinaire. Après la thérapie néoadjuvante, le stade tumoral était à nouveau déterminé par CT (thorax, abdomen et pelvis),   endoscopieécho-endosco-pie (EUS), éventuellement TEP au fluorodésoxyglucose. Tous les patients ont  bénéficié d’une exérèse radicale  et l’analyse histolo-gique finale (ypTBNM) a été réalisée par un pathologiste spécialisé. Le stade pathologique a été déterminé en utilisant la 7\\ne édition du \\nsystème de stadification TNM de «  l’American Joint Committe on \\nCancer ».7 Une régression du stade tumoral était définie comme \\nune réduction du stade T ou N de la stadification pathologique (ypTNM), par comparaison au stade clinique (cTNM). La régression tumorale pathologique utilisait une échelle catégorielle allant de\\n \\n1 \\n(réponse pathologique complète) à 5 (absence de réponse), telle que décrite à l’origine par Mandard.\\n8Prise en charge clinique\\nDurant la période d’étude, qui allait du 1er janvier 2000 au \\n31 décembre 2010, la pratique de la chimiothérapie a rapidement évolué au Royaume-Uni. Après la publication d’un important essai multicentrique randomisé,\\n2 l’administration de deux cycles préopé-\\nratoires de cisplatine et de fluorouracile est devenue le traitement de référence du cancer de l’œsophage résécable. Un second essai randomisé mené au Royaume-Uni, dans lequel les patients avaient reçu trois cycles préopératoires d’épirubicine, de cisplatine et de fluorouracile (ECF), suivis de trois cycles du même schéma après intervention chirurgicale, a été publié en 2006.\\n1 En 2008, les résul-\\ntats finaux d’un autre essai randomisé dans lequel le fluorouracile avait été remplacé sans toxicité majeure par une fluoropyrimidine orale, la capécitabine, ont été publiés ; c’est alors que l’épirubicine, le cisplatine et la capécitabine ont largement remplacé l’association ECF. \\n9\\nLes seuils d’indication de la chimiothérapie ont également été \\nréduits au cours de cette décennie, incluant initialement tous les patients dont la tumeur était au stade T3 ou chez qui les ganglions lymphatiques étaient atteints, puis plus tard (depuis 2005), les patients dont la maladie était au stade T2N0. Le groupe de patients de la période initiale de l’étude qui ne répondaient pas aux critères d’éligibilité pour la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante et les patients à qui une chimiothérapie n’avait pas été administrée pour des raisons médicales ou par choix personnel, ont servi de groupe témoin. La présente étude n’a jamais eu l’intention spécifique de comparer des schémas de chimiothérapie : elle visait purement à analyser les effets globaux de la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante sur le devenir des patients. L’approche chirurgicale consistait en une œsophagecto-mie transhiatale ou transthoracique, principalement dictée par la préférence de chaque chirurgien.\\nAnalyse statistique\\nDes statistiques descriptives ont été utilisées pour présenter les \\nrésultats démographiques et oncologiques. L’analyse de la survie a été réalisée en utilisant la méthode de Kaplan-Meier et le test du \\nlog-rank , et la valeur p < 0,05 a été utilisée pour déterminer la \\nsignificativité statistique. La survie était calculée à compter de la date de l’intervention chirurgicale. Le test exact de Fisher et le test χ\\n2 ont servi à évaluer les variables catégorielles, alors que le test  t \\net le test U de Mann-Whitney \\nont été utilisés pour analyser les \\nvariables continues.\\nDes modèles de risques proportionnels de Cox ont été utilisés \\npour calculer les risques relatifs (RR) avec des IC à 95 % pour l’asso-ciation entre la régression du stade tumoral (exposition durant l’étude) et les deux principaux résultats de l’étude, à savoir la survie globale et la survie sans maladie. Des analyses brutes (modèle 1) et ajustées (modèle 2) ont été effectuées. Dans le modèle multiva-rié, les marqueurs du pronostic étaient ajustés, en incluant l’âge du patient (continu), le stade tumoral clinique (T1/2N0, T1/2N+, T3/4N0 ou T3/4N+), le grade tumoral (bien, modérément ou peu différencié), l’envahissement lympho-vasculaire (oui ou non), le statut des marges de résection (R0 ou R1) et le type de résection chirurgicale (œsophagectomie transhiatale ou transthoracique). Le stade tumoral pathologique et les scores de régression tumorale de Mandard ont été exclus du modèle parce que ces paramètres reflètent également la réponse de la tumeur à la chimiothérapie. Pour confirmer l’hypothèse d’un  modèle à risques proportionnels, unecorrélation a été calculée entre les résidus de Schoenfeld pour les covariables et le classement par ordre d’importance des dates des \\n338_JCO-5_davies.indd   339 18/12/2014   10:31195.254.160.194Information downloaded from jco.ascopubs.org and provided by at Hospices Civils De Lyon on February 25, 2016 from\\nCopyright © 2014 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Les caractéristiques démographiques des patients ayant participé à l’étude et les données relatives à la stadification sont indiquées dans le tableau 1. Le taux de mortalité à l’hôpital était de 2,5 %, et la durée moyenne de l’hospitalisation de 15 jours. La survie globale de la cohorte était de 80 % et de 45 % à 1 et  \\n5 ans,  respectivement.\\nLa chirurgie consistait en une œsophagectomie transhiatale \\n(n = 232) et transthoracique (n = 353). Trois chirurgiens ont réalisé ou surveillé toutes les opérations, et il n’y pas eu de différence au niveau de la mortalité ou de la survie, selon chaque chirurgien ou service ayant effectué l’intervention chirurgicale. Le taux global de résections R0 était de 60 %, en utilisant les critères d’une marge positive (c’est-à-dire tumeur située à 1 mm ou moins de la marge de résection circonférentielle) du « Royal College of Pathologists\\n \\n».10 \\nCela correspondait à un taux de résections R0 de 87 % en utili-sant la définition de « l’\\nAmerican College of Pathologists  ».7 Les \\nnombres  médians de ganglions lymphatiques prélevés étaient de 19 ganglions lymphathiques dans le groupe avec régression tumo-rale et de 18 ganglions lymphatiques dans le groupe sans régression tumorale (p  = 0,7741).\\nLes schémas chimiothérapeutiques prédominants incluaient le cisplatine et le fluorouracile (n = 57),  le schéma ECF (n = 218) et l’épirubicine, le cisplatine et la capécitabine (n = 112), ce qui correspondait aux 387 (96 %) des 400 patients qui ont reçu une chimiothérapie néoadjuvante. La majorité des patients (n = 380\\n \\n; \\n95 %) a reçu deux, trois ou quatre cycles de traitement néoad-juvant. Le schéma de chimiothérapie n’a pas significativement affecté la probabilité de régression du stade tumoral (p   = 0,6665)\\nEffet  de la chimiothérapie sur la tumeur\\nDans le groupe recevant la chimiothérapie adjuvante, 175 \\npatients (44 %) ont présenté une réponse tumorale. Ce groupe de répondeurs, comparé à celui des non répondeurs, a obtenu de meilleurs taux de résection in sano (R0 : 74 % vs 40 %, respective-ment\\n \\n; p < 0,001) et des taux plus faibles de récidive locale isolée \\n(6 % vs 13\\n \\n%, respectivement ; p  = 0,03). Les répondeurs ont aussi \\nprésenté de plus faibles taux de récidive métastatique systémique, comparés aux non répondeurs, à la fois isolée (19 % vs 29 %, respectivement ; p  = 0,027) et accompagnée d’une récidive loco-\\nrégionale (30 % vs 48 %, respectivement ; p  < 0,001). La majorité \\ndes patients ayant obtenu une régression tumorale présentait une réponse pathologique à la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante (score de régression tumorale de Mandard compris entre 1 et 4 chez 144 des 162 patients ; 89 %). Ce groupe de patients répondeurs a obtenu des scores de régression tumorale de Mandard significativement améliorés, comparé aux patients non répondeurs (p  < 0,001).\\nChez les patients traités par chirurgie première, la stadification \\nclinique était exacte chez 78 % des patients (stade correctement déterminé, n = 144 [78 %] ; le stade avait été sous-estimé chez 30 patients [16 %] et il avait été surestimé chez 11 patients [6 %]). Cependant, la stadification radiologique post-chimiothérapie n’a pas départagé les patients répondeurs à la chimiothérapie et les patients non répondeurs à celle-ci (CT montrant une réponse à la chimiothérapie : régression tumorale, 59 % ; absence de régression tumorale, 61 % ; p  = 0,86).\\n338_JCO-5_davies.indd   341 18/12/2014   10:31195.254.160.194Information downloaded from jco.ascopubs.org and provided by at Hospices Civils De Lyon on February 25, 2016 from\\nCopyright © 2014 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Chez les patients dont la maladie était au stade cT3/4N+ et chez qui la chimiothérapie avait permis un downstaging la tumeur, la survie à 5 ans était significativement améliorée, comparé au groupe sans régression de la maladie (52,5 % vs 12,6 %, respectivement ;  \\np < 0,001 ; Fig. A1 en Annexe, en ligne uniquement).\\nLes figures 1 à 4 représentent une analyse de la survie plus \\ndétaillée des patients de stade initial cT3/4N+ qui sont passés après chimiothérapie à un  stade ypT0N0 (Fig. 1), ypT1/2N- (Fig. 2), ypT1/2N+ (Fig. 3) ou ypT3/4N- (Fig. 4). Dans chaque graphique, les deux courbes témoins représentent les patients appariés par stade, qui n’ont pas reçu de chimiothérapie néoadjuvante (pTNM) et les patients non répondeurs (Stade ypT3/4N+ après  résection chirurgicale). Dans toutes les analyses de  survie, on a observé un bénéfice significatif au  chez les répondeurs à la chimiothérapie, par rapport aux non répondeurs (p  < 0,001) ; par en revanche, aucune différence n’a été observée entre les répondeurs et les témoins appariés par stade.\\nDISCUSSION\\nCette étude indique que l’efficacité locale déjà démontrée de la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante dans l’adénocarcinome de l’œso-phage résécable est également associée à un taux de récidive systé-mique réduit et à une amélioration globale de la survie, indépen-dante des autres facteurs pronostiques connus.

Ainsi, le stade tumoral après la chimiothérapie néoadju-vante semble être plus important que le stade initial à la présenta-tion, en termes d’évaluation du pronostic.\\nCertains problèmes méthodologiques méritent que l’on y prête \\nattention. Cette étude prévoyait un suivi à long terme d’une grande cohorte de patients traités par d’une chimiothérapie néoadjuvante  chirurgie pour un cancer de l’œsophage. Pour autant que nous le sachions, aucune autre étude antérieure n’a réussi à quantifier les effets, locaux et systémiques, de la thérapie sur la régression du stade tumoral de cette manière et à les associer à de solides données de suivi à long terme. Toutefois, cette étude n’avait pas été conçue comme un essai randomisé et, de ce fait, bien qu’elle ait été ajustée pour plusieurs facteurs de confusion éventuels, elle est sujette certains biais. Bien que deux centres aient fourni les données, les principes de la stadification et de la gestion étaient similaires et il n’y avait pas de différence au niveau des résultats selon chaque chirurgien ou service concerné. Nous avions décidé d’analyser exclusivement des patients atteints d’un adénocarci-nome, afin d’adhérer au principe du traitement de ces tumeurs en tant qu’entités pathologiques distinctes des carcinomes épider-moïdes. Ne pas le faire pourrait introduire un biais, comme cela a été montré  dans les essais contrôlés randomisés qui ont retrouvé une différence d’effet du traitement entre les sous-types de tumeurs œsophagiennes \\n11. Bien que notre étude contienne une association \\nde résections transhiatales et transthoraciques, le type de chirur-gien’a eu aucun impact sur la survie globale ou la récidive de la maladie après ajustement en fonction des facteurs de confusion.\\n12\\nLa pertinence clinique de notre étude est qu’elle montre que \\nle stade pathologique après la chimiothérapie est fortement corrélé au pronostic, alors que la stadification initiale pré-traitement l’est nettement moins. Cela indique que les procédures de stadifica-tion diagnostiques (telles que la TEP-TDM-, l’écho-endoscopie ou l’imagerie par résonance magnétique) doivent être utilisées après la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante. Les principales décisions cliniques doivent être prises d’après cette stadification et non d’après la stadification initiale. Le principal but de la stadification initiale serait d’identifier toutes les métastases à distance (ce qui exclut tout traitement à visée curative) et de servir de référence à partir de laquelle on peut évalueer la réponse au traitement. Cela constitue une nouvelle approche clinique qui pourrait améliorer la prise de décisions  et la survie après un traitement à visée curative. \\nDans notre étude, le stade pathologique a été utilisé comme \\ncritère de substitution pour le stade post-chimiothérapie. L’uti-lisation de l’imagerie pour prédire le stade post-chimiothérapie serait sans doute à même de guider au mieux  la prise en charge ultérieure. Toutefois, cette étude était destinée à servir d’essai de validation, pour identifier le fondement du bénéfice de la chimio-thérapie et tenter de quantifier un tel bénéfice d’une manière pratique. Ce faisant, l’utilisation du stade pathologique final pour définir les répondeurs est, par nature, plus précis. Nous avons pu montrer qu’un patient porteur d’une tumeur au stade T3N2 qui a régressé jusqu’au stade T1N0 a une survie équivalente à celle d’un patient dont la tumeur était au stade T1N0 dès le début. Cette approche simple a une valeur pratique puisque nous cherchons à sélectionner des patients candidats à la chirurgie, mais elle dépend fondamentalement de notre aptitude à déterminer le stade de la maladie des patients avant et après la chimiothérapie.Nous avons tenté d’aborder les deux autres explications pos-\\nsibles de l’observation faite dans notre étude, à savoir que la régres-sion du stade tumoral est d’une importance cruciale pour le devenir de ces patients. La première est que les patients considérés comme ayant obtenu « une régression du stade tumoral » avaient simple-ment été sur-stadifiés à la présentation. Bien que l’on puisse conce-voir que cela explique un petit pourcentage du bénéfice observé dans notre étude, nos données suggérent que la stadification ini-tiale a davantage tendance à sous-estimer plutôt qu’à surestimer le stade de la maladie, une tendance observée notamment dans  le \\nFig. 3.

Chez 78 % de ces patients, le stade de la maladie avait été correctement déterminé et il n’avait été surestimé que dans 6 % des cas. Compte tenu de l’ampleur du bénéfice apporté par la chimiothérapie première, qui s’est manifesté sous la forme d’une régression du stade, il est difficile de comprendre qu’une surestimation du stade si peu fréquente puisse avoir eu un impact significatif sur les résultats globaux de notre étude. Qui plus est, le fait que nos patients dont la maladie avait régressé aient obtenu de bien meilleurs scores de régression tumorale de Mandard suggère que la sélection de ce groupe est valide. Finalement, l’argument selon lequel les patients ayant obtenu une régression tumorale pourraient représenter une cohorte avec une biologie tumorale favorable est contredit par le fait que la régression du stade tumoral était le facteur pronostique indépendant le plus significatif dans le modèle  multivarié, qui était ajusté en fonction de ces caracté-ristiques.\\nL’observation selon laquelle la survie d’un patient pourrait \\nêtre déterminée par le stade de sa maladie après la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante renforce l’idée que les patients qui répondent à une chimiothérapie peuvent toutefois encore être considérés comme candidats à un traitement radical, quel que soit le stade initial de leur maladie. Cependant, les patients qui n’ont pas répondu à la chimiothérapie ont survécu moins longtemps que les patients à un stade équivalent qui avaient subi une intervention chirurgicale pre-mière. Il est illogique dans ce scénario de continuer à administrer une chimiothérapie inefficace n’apportant aucun bénéfice et qui, de plus, aggrave la morbidité globale du traitement.\\nCes résultats soulignent combien il est important d’adapter la \\nthérapie au cas par cas. De tels algorithmes pourraient inclure une thérapie systémique prolongée chez les patients qui répondent bien au traitement, avec intensification des traitements néoadjuvants (par exemple association d’une radiothérapie à la chimiothérapie) chez les patients présentant des tumeurs localement défavorables (par exemple marges chirurgicales potentiellement limites) ou de diriger des patients sélectionnés avec soin vers une chirurgie précoce en l’absence de réponse à la thérapie d’induction. Cer-tains patients qui continuent à avoir de mauvaises caractéristiques pronostiques après la chimiothérapie risquent de ne pas du tout bénéficier de la chirurgie. Une condition requise pour adopter cette approche personnalisée est l’aptitude à mesurer la réponse à la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante avec précision. Malheureusement, il n’existe pas de marqueurs moléculaires prédictifs validés pour la réponse à la chimiothérapie. La régression tumorale pathologique pourrait être associée à des améliorations de la survie,\\n8 mais cela \\nn’est pas couramment utilisé à titre d’information lors de la prise de décisions concernant la thérapie. Tout le monde sait que l’ima-gerie par tomodensitométrie (CT) n’est pas suffisamment précise lorsqu’il s’agit de mesurer la réponse à la chimiothérapie, et bien que l’addition de la TEP et de l’écho-endoscopie puisse améliorer la précision d’une restadification, ces limites excluent actuellement une thérapie individualisée.\\n13\\nLes bénéfices de la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante en termes \\nde régression du stade de la maladie ont déjà été rapportés.4 Nos \\nrésultats sont en accord avec cela et démontrent qu’un pourcentage important de patients obtiennent une réduction du stade, qui se traduit par une plus longue survie, de meilleurs taux de résection chirurgicale et une réduction des récidives locorégionales.\\nCe qui est nettement plus contestable, c’est la question de \\nsavoir si, et dans quelle mesure, la chimiothérapie a un effet systé-mique additionnel.\\n5 Si la réponse à cette question est « non », alors \\nil semblerait logique de traiter tous les patients par chimio-radiothé-rapie parce que cela se traduirait par des taux plus élevés de réponse pathologique et de résection complète de la tumeur primitive et des vaisseaux lymphatiques qui l’entourent.\\n11,14 Cependant, on \\npourrait craindre  que la plus faible dose – radiosensibilisante – de chimiothérapie systémique qu’un tel traitement implique soit peu susceptible d’avoir des effets thérapeutiques systémiques. Qui plus est, la probabilité de micrométastases systémiques sous-jacentes au moment d’une intervention chirurgicale pour un cancer de l’œsophage est élevée.\\n15 Une majorité écrasante de patients, voire \\nmême ceux ayant présenté une réponse pathologique complète après la chimiothérapie, meurent de maladie métastatique.\\n16-18 \\nUn important pourcentage de patients porteurs de tumeurs N0 présentent des  micrométastases dans les ganglions lymphatiques, ce pourcentage dépassant 30 % dans certaines études.\\n19-22 Des  \\nmyélogrammes systématiques ont également montré que jusqu’à 60 % des patients opérés d’ un cancer de l’œsophage ont des cel-lules malignes circulantes.\\n15,23 En l’absence d’effet systémique du \\ntraitement, tous ces patients décèderaient  vraisemblablement des suites de leur maladie. Les bénéfices de la chimiothérapie néo -\\nadjuvante pour les patients répondeurs dans notre étude sont convaincants, une réduction de 57 % du risque de récidive du cancer et de décès ayant été démontrée chez 44 % des patients dont la maladie avait régressé. Ce bénéfice est significativement plus important que la réduction du risque relatif démontrée dans les essais cliniques pertinents,\\n1-3 qui prennent en compte à la fois \\ndes répondeurs et des non répondeurs. Il est bon de noter que les bénéfices de la chimiothérapie systémique ne se limitent pas à la régression du stade tumoral\\n \\n; nous avons démontré, en outre, une \\nréduction concurrente de la survenue d’une maladie métastatique systémique chez les patients répondeurs, fournissant ainsi des preuves solides de l’élimination des micrométastases. Nous avons rapporté auparavant que le stade pathologique (après la chimio-thérapie) et la réponse tumorale pathologique (score de régression tumorale de Mandard) sont indépendamment pronostiques après une œsophagectomie.\\n17 Si la chimiothérapie n’a servi qu’à faire \\nrégresser la tumeur primaire, alors ces deux paramètres ne pour-raient pas être mutuellement exclusifs, et tout le bénéfice de la chimiothérapie serait représenté par le downstaging de la maladie après la chimiothérapie. De ce fait, nous sommes persuadés que les bénéfices de la régression du stade sont indépendants de la régres-sion tumorale pathologique et la complètent. Compte tenu des taux élevés de récidive systémique chez ces patients et la réduction convaincante au niveau de la récidive à la fois locale et systémique démontrée dans notre étude avec la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante, nous pensons qu’elle constitue un traitement approprié pour de tels patients.\\nEn conclusion, cette étude indique que le stade tumoral \\naprès la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante détermine la survie chez les patients atteints d’un adénocarcinome de l’œsophage et de la jonction œsogastrique. L’importance de la régression du stade de la tumeur, en termes de survie, de résection chirurgicale complète et de profil des récidives, a d’importantes implications cliniques. La démonstration d’un effet systémique de la chimiothérapie est particulièrement signifiant dans la mesure  où la stratégie thérapeu-tique néoadjuvante optimale pour ces cancers demeure un  sujet de controverse. Il est indispensable d’améliorer l’évaluation de la réponse à la chimiothérapie néoadjuvante si nous tenons à adopter avec succès une politique de thérapie individualisée.\\n338_JCO-5_davies.indd   344 18/12/2014   10:31195.254.160.194Information downloaded from jco.ascopubs.org and provided by at Hospices Civils De Lyon on February 25, 2016 from\\nCopyright © 2014 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Therefore, we aimed to test \\nthe efficacy of EPA and aspirin, alone and in combination and compared with a placebo, in individuals with sporadic colorectal neoplasia detected at colonoscopy.\\nMethods In a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2\\n × 2 factorial trial, patients aged 55–73 years \\nwho were identified during colonoscopy as being at high risk in the English Bowel Cancer Screening Programme \\n(BCSP; ≥3 adenomas if at least one was ≥10 mm in diameter or ≥5 adenomas if these were <10 mm in diameter) were recruited from 53 BCSP endoscopy units in England, UK. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1:1:1) using a secure web-based server to receive 2 g EPA-free fatty acid (FFA) per day (either as the FFA or triglyceride), 300 mg aspirin per day, \\nboth treatments in combination, or placebo for 12 months using random permuted blocks of randomly varying \\nsize, and stratified by BCSP site. Research staff and participants were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the adenoma detection rate (ADR; the proportion of participants with any adenoma) at 1 year surveillance colonoscopy analysed in all participants with observable follow-up data using a so-called at-the-margins approach, adjusted for BCSP site and repeat endoscopy at baseline. The safety population included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry, number ISRCTN05926847.\\nFindings Between Nov 11, 2011, and June 10, 2016, 709 participants were randomly assigned to four treatment groups \\n(176 to placebo, 179 to EPA, 177 to aspirin, and 177 to EPA plus aspirin). Adenoma outcome data were available for \\n163 (93%) patients in the placebo group, 153 (85%) in the EPA group, 163 (92%) in the aspirin group, and 161 (91%) in the EPA plus aspirin group. The ADR was 61% (100 of 163) in the placebo group, 63% (97 of 153) in the EPA group, 61% (100 of 163) in the aspirin group, and 61% (98 of 161) in the EPA plus aspirin group, with no evidence of any effect for EPA (risk ratio [RR] 0·98, 95% CI 0·87 to 1·12; risk difference –0·9%, –8·8 to 6·9; p=0·81) or aspirin (RR 0·99 (0·87 to 1·12; risk difference –0·6%, –8·5 to 7·2; p=0·88). EPA and aspirin were well tolerated (78 [44%] of 176 had ≥1 adverse event in the placebo group compared with 82 [46%] in the EPA group, 68 [39%] in the aspirin group, and 76 [45%] in the EPA plus aspirin group), although the number of gastrointestinal adverse events was increased in the EPA alone group at 146 events (compared with 85 in the placebo group, 86 in the aspirin group, and 68 in the aspirin plus placebo group). Six upper-gastrointestinal bleeding events were reported across the treatment groups (two in the EPA group, three in the aspirin group, and one in the placebo group).\\nInterpretation Neither EPA nor aspirin treatment were associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients with \\nat least one colorectal adenoma. Further research is needed regarding the effect on colorectal adenoma number \\naccording to adenoma type and location. Optimal use of EPA and aspirin might need a precision medicine approach to adenoma recurrence.\\nFunding Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation Programme, a UK Medical Research Council and National Institute for \\nHealth Research partnership.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

This complexity is reflected by two main histological types of precursor lesion (the conventional adenoma and ser\\n rated adenoma, which is \\nnow termed sessile serrated lesion, \\nrecognising that no \\ndysplasia is present in most serrated polyps),8 which map \\ndifferently against molecular char  acteristics including \\nchromosomal instability, micro  satellite instability, and \\nCpG island DNA hypermethylation (CIMP).9\\nThe naturally occurring omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty \\nacid (PUFA) C20:5n3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is licensed for treatment of severe hypertriglycerid  aemia \\nthat is unresponsive to other \\ntherapies and has clinical \\nproof-of-concept as a colorectal cancer chemo  prevention \\nagent from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, in which 2 g EPA free fatty \\nacid (FFA) per day for 6 months was \\nassociated with a significant reduction in rectal adenoma number and size.\\n10 Omega-3 PUFAs have been shown to \\nhave an excellent safety and tolerability profile on the basis of vast cardiology experience.\\n11\\nA robust body of evidence exists from polyp prevention \\nRCTs in individuals undergoing colonoscopic surveil -\\nlance after colorectal adenoma \\nclearance,12 as well as \\nlong-term follow-up of colorectal cancer outcomes after aspirin RCTs with vascular endpoints, that aspirin prevents colorectal cancer.\\n13 However, aspirin has not \\nbeen adopted for sporadic colorectal cancer chemo -\\nprevention to date, because of uncertainty about dose and the most appropriate target population balancing colorectal cancer risk and adverse event (ie, bleeding) profile.\\n14\\nThe National Health Service (NHS) Bowel Cancer \\nScreening Programme (BCSP) in England provides population-level colorectal cancer screening using guaiac faecal occult blood testing, high quality-assured screening colonoscopy, and surveillance on the basis of colorectal adenoma number and characteristics,\\n2 thus pro  vid ing an \\nexcellent opportunity for an \\nRCT of chemoprevention in \\nindividuals at high risk of future colorectal neoplasia.\\nColorectal adenoma risk reduction has previously \\nbeen shown at 1 year in polyp prevention RCTs of Research in context\\nEvidence before this study\\nWe searched PubMed for articles published in English between Jan 1, 1990, and Jan 1, 2011, using the terms “colorectal cancer”, “colorectal adenoma”, “chemoprevention”, “omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid”, “aspirin”, and “clinical trial”. We found one small randomised trial of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) for colorectal cancer chemoprevention in familial adenomatous polyposis and four randomised sporadic polyp prevention trials of aspirin, which used varying doses in different risk populations.\\nAdded value of this study\\nTo our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial of EPA for sporadic colorectal cancer chemoprevention and the first evaluation of aspirin in a high-risk population within a high quality-assured national bowel cancer screening programme.\\nEPA and aspirin did not reduce the proportion of individuals \\nwith any colorectal adenoma (adenoma detection rate [ADR]), but they both decreased the recurrence of some subtypes of adenoma, measured by adenoma number, 1 year after clearance screening colonoscopy. There was evidence of selectivity for adenoma type and location.Implications of all the available evidenceAlthough our trial found no effect on the primary outcome of the proportion of patients with at least one adenoma, both EPA and aspirin show some chemoprevention efficacy for colorectal cancer. The larger effect size of aspirin adds to the weight of evidence for its use in combination with endoscopic screening and surveillance, which provides suboptimal protection against right-sided colorectal cancer.\\nOur findings suggest that a precision medicine approach \\n(for adenoma type and location) to colorectal cancer chemoprevention will be necessary, which mirrors best practice in colorectal cancer treatment based on molecular stratification.\\nThe trial raises the crucial question of whether ADR or \\nadenoma number is the best measure of chemoprevention efficacy in polyp prevention trials that are based on quality-assured colonoscopy in individuals at high risk of colorectal cancer, in which the ADR is used as a performance indicator, and the adenoma recurrence rate is high.', metadata={'source': './articles\\\\389e08a4394a7b5dc18d61e575bb3a2fe62d50d4.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Articleswww.thelancet.com   Published online November 19, 2018   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ S0140-6736(18)31775-6  3aspirin and metformin.12,15,16 Therefore, we aimed to test \\nthe chemo  prevention efficacy of EPA and \\naspirin, alone \\nand in combination, in individuals with high-risk \\ncolorectal adenoma features at screening colonoscopy, who sub\\n sequently had a surveillance colonoscopy at \\n1 year, in the BCSP.\\nMethods\\nStudy design and participants\\nThe Systematic Evaluation of Aspirin and Fish Oil (seAFOod) Polyp Prevention Trial was a multicentre, \\nrandomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2\\n × 2 facto -\\nr ial trial. The trial protocol \\nhas been published elsewhere.17 \\nApproval was obtained from the Trent Research Ethics Committee (10/H0405/90). The seAFOod trial was done in 53 hospital endoscopy units in the English BCSP using its strict protocol-driven and quality-assured practice and reporting mechanisms.\\n2 The trial gained approval from \\nthe English BCSP Research Committee.\\nIndividuals aged 55–73 years who were identified as \\nhigh risk at a complete BCSP screening colonos  copy \\n(three or more colorectal adenomas with at least one ≥10 mm in diameter, or five or more colorectal adenomas that were <10 \\nmm in diameter) were screened \\nfor trial eligibility. For participants who had a bowel scope flexible sigmoidoscopy in the BCSP, eligibility was established on the basis of combined colorectal adenoma findings from the flexible sigmoidoscopy and subsequent colonoscopy.\\nAll individuals at high risk were provided with written \\ntrial information after colonoscopy and then attended a routine BCSP outpatient visit 7–14 days later, dur\\n-\\ning which written informed consent was obtained if they were eligible. Exclusion criteria included require\\n-\\nment for more than one \\nrepeat colonoscopy or flexible \\nsigmoidoscopy within the 3 month BCSP screening window, regular (>3 doses per week) prescribed or over-the-counter (OTC) aspirin or non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and concomitant warfarin therapy or use of any other anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent.\\n17 A complete list of all inclusion and \\nexclusion criteria can be found in the protocol summary on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) registry.\\nRandomisation and masking\\nParticipants were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to \\neither EPA plus aspirin; EPA plus placebo; aspirin plus placebo; or placebo plus placebo. Randomisation occurred within 4 weeks from the screening colonoscopy \\nby research staff at each site using a secure web-based system with treatment assignment established by a pseudorandom code, using random permuted blocks of randomly varying size. Stratification was done by BCSP site.\\nThe sequence of treatment allocations was concealed \\nuntil recruitment, data collection, and database lock were completed. Investigational medicinal product (IMP) allocation was not divulged to any research staff or participant.\\nProcedures\\nParticipants who were randomly assigned to receive EPA received either 2 g 99% EPA-FFA per day (as two 500 mg gastro-resistant capsules taken twice per day with food, supplied by SLA Pharma AG, Liestal, Switzerland), as used in the previous RCT in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis,\\n10 or an equivalent FFA dose as 2780 mg \\n90% EPA-triglyceride per day (as five soft gelatine capsules per day split between two meals, purchased from Igennus Healthcare Nutrition, Cambridge, UK; appendix). Those assigned to receive a placebo of EPA received the respective identical-looking capsules (both containing mixed capric and capryllic acid medium-chain triglycer\\n-\\nides). Participants also received either one 300 mg enteric-coated aspirin tablet per day with food or an identical placebo tablet (both supplied by Bayer AG, Leverkusen, G\\nermany). Capsule and tablet were taken \\nuntil the day before surveillance (exit) colonoscopy, which was scheduled 12 months after screening. Dur\\n-\\ning the intervention phase, SLA Pharma were unable to supply sufficient EPA-FFA capsules, which \\nresulted in a \\nswitch to the EPA-triglyceride formulation (appendix). Each participant received only one formulation of EPA (either FFA or triglyceride) or its matching placebo.\\nParticipants could withdraw from the trial at any time. \\nWhen a participant withdrew from the intervention only, follow-up occurred per protocol. If a participant withdrew from the trial, data collected up to the point of withdrawal were included in the analyses.\\nParticipants completed a European Prospective \\nInvestigation into Cancer and Nutrition short food frequency questionnaire at study entry and after sur\\n-\\nveillance colonoscopy at 12 months, for categorisation of total and oily fish intake (appendix). A prescription was issued for the supply of the IMP by the local hospital pharmacy at randomisation and at clinical review at 6 months. Blood \\n(for plasma, red blood cells, and \\nleucocytes) and urine samples were obtained at study entry, at 6 months, and at surveillance colonoscopy. Rectal mucosa (four biopsy samples of macroscopically normal mucosa ≤2 cm from any polyp) was collected at the end of the surveillance colonoscopy.\\n17 Telephone \\nconsultations were done at 2 weeks, 12 weeks, and 38 weeks after randomisation to monitor for adverse events (with emphasis on emergent gastrointestinal symptoms), check concomitant medication use, and confirm IMP compliance.

The secondary outcomes were as follows: the proportion of participants with advanced (≥10 mm diameter, high-grade dysplasia, or villous histology) colorectal adenomas and with conventional (this term encompassing tubular, tubulovillous, and villous adenomas was adopted only after database lock), serrated, left-sided, and right-sided colorectal adenoma subtypes (serrated adenoma was added as a secondary endpoint to the SAP before database lock); the mean number of colorectal adenomas per participant for all colorectal adenomas, and for advanced, conventional, serrated, left-sided, and right-sided colorectal adenoma subtypes; the number of participants at high risk who were reclassified as being at intermediate risk (BCSP guidelines mandate that any individual who does not continue to fulfil high-risk criteria should be classified as being at intermediate risk for 3-year surveillance colonoscopy); development of colorectal cancer; dietary fish and other seafood intake at baseline and at 12 months; red blood cell and rectal mucosal PUFA concentrations; and adverse events, including clinically signifi\\n cant bleeding episodes (haemorrhagic \\nstroke or gastro  intestinal bleeding).17 Post-hoc exploratory \\nanalyses were done on colorectal adenoma size, the relationship be\\n tween individual rectal mucosal EPA \\nlevels and colorectal adenoma number\\n, and the \\nassociation between rectal mucosal and red blood cell EPA levels at 12 months.

The log relative risk was estimated using a mixed effects log-binomial regression model, with BCSP site as a random effect and the risk difference and ratio presented with the 95% CI. Both interventions were fitted simultaneously and the analysis was adjusted according to whether a repeat endoscopic screening procedure was required and according to BCSP site. Sensitivity analyses were done to support the primary analysis. All secondary analyses assumed that data were missing at random and no imputation was done. Data are presented as the risk difference for the binary ADR outcomes and the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for continuous data (ie, the mean number of adenomas per participant).\\nTreatment-emergent adverse events and adverse \\ndrug reactions were summarised by MedDRA system organ class. Gastrointestinal adverse events were also summarised by MedDRA preferred term and EPA formulation (FFA or triglyceride). The worst case (severe event or event related to trial treatment) was assumed if severity or causality data were missing. Clinically significant bleeding episodes (haemorrhagic stroke or acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding re\\n quiring hospital \\nadmission or investigation) were identi  fied by the chief \\ninvestigator (MAH) using a manual search of all adverse events. Common gastrointestinal adverse events were presented separately as clinically meaningful symptom categories, as defined by the chief investigator.\\nT\\nhe statistical analysis plan was finalised before \\ndatabase lock on Aug 31, 2017 . The plan included comparison of the EPA formula\\n tions (safety and \\ntolerability, as well as EPA incorporation), analysis \\nof \\nserrated adenoma outcomes, and de  finition of the analysis \\npopulation to include only participants with observed follow-up data, compared with the analysis described in\\n \\nthe protocol.17 Extra sensitivity analyses of the pri -\\nmary outcome (BCSP centre and \\nsite as random effects \\nin a multilevel model, without adjustment for repeat endoscopy, baseline red blood cell EPA levels, and oily fish intake), conventional colorectal adenoma outcomes, and the aforementioned exploratory analyses were later added.\\nAll statistical analyses were done using Stata \\nversion 15.0. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN05926847 .\\nRole of the funding source\\nThe funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\\nResults\\nPatients were recruited between Nov 11, 2011, and June 10, 2016 (mandated by the maximum shelf life of EPA-triglyceride specified by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency; appendix). During this period, 3911 individuals who were defined as high risk by the BCSP were identified and assessed for eligibility, of whom 3202 (82%) were excluded (figure 1). Existing aspirin or other NSAID use occurred in 594 (15%) screened individuals at high risk, and concur\\n-\\nrent anticoagulant or non-aspirin anti  platelet agent use \\nwas an exclusion criterion in 313 (8%) patients. Overall, \\n709 (18%) patients were randomly assigned, 176 to placebo, 179 to EPA alone, 177 to aspirin alone, and 177 to EPA plus aspirin. 641 (90%) patients had a surveillance colonoscopy, with colorectal adenoma \\noutcome data \\navailable for 640 (90%) individuals (figure 1). 422 (60%) participants were randomly assigned to active EPA-FFA or placebo (109 to placebo, 108 to EPA, 101 to aspirin, and 104 to EPA plus aspirin) and 287 (40%) participants were randomly assigned to active EPA-triglyceride or placebo (67 to placebo, 71 to EPA, 76 to aspirin, and 73 to EPA plus aspirin).\\nBaseline characteristics were well balanced across \\nthe four treatment groups (table 1). The mean age of participants was 65 years (IQR 62–69) and 80% were men, reflecting the high-risk patient demo\\n graphic in the \\nEnglish BCSP.17 We noted a slight imbalance across \\ngroups with respect to smoking status, with fewer current smokers present in the EPA treatment group.

Compliance with both capsule and tablet IMPs was excellent, with mean com\\n-\\npliance percentage as measured by capsule and tablet counting being 94–97% (appendix). During the inter\\n-\\nvention phase, 18 (26%) of 707 participants started other regular medication, which was balanced across treatment groups (appendix). Dietary fish intake was similar across treatment groups (appendix), with no discernible differ\\n-\\nence between the groups regarding the proportion of people who changed their dietary fish intake during the intervention (appendix).\\nAs expected, individuals in the EPA treatment group \\nshowed an increase in red blood cell and rectal mucosal EPA content compared with baseline values, \\nunlike the \\ntrial groups that did not include active EPA treatment (figure 2). Comparison of red blood cell and rectal mucosal EPA concentrations during the intervention and comparison of the change from baseline values in individuals who received active EPA capsules confirmed that EPA incorporation during the trial was similar between participants who were allocated FFA or triglyceride capsules (figure 2; appendix). No evidence of conversion from EPA to the other main bioactive long-chain omega-3 PUFA C22:6n3 docosahexaenoic acid was observed, and there was no evidence of a clear reduction in tissue C20:4n6 arachidonic acid content, in red blood cells or in the rectum (appendix). The ratio of EPA to arachidonic acid, which is often reported as a therapeutic response biomarker of EPA in cardiovascular trials,\\n11 was \\nsimilar in red blood cells and the rectum of participants who received either FFA or triglyceride (appendix).\\nThe median time between randomisation and sur\\n-\\nveillance colonoscopy was 344–349 days (table 2). The primary outcome (total ADR) was similar across the four treatment groups (100 [61%] of 163 patients in the placebo group vs 97 [63%] of 153 in the EPA group \\nvs 100 [61%] of \\n163 in the aspirin group vs 98 [61%] of 161 in the EPA plus \\naspirin group; table 2). There was no evidence of an interaction between EPA and aspirin for the ADR (interaction risk difference –1·5%, 95% CI –17·1 to 14·2, p\\ninteraction =0·8530). Therefore, the ADR was analysed \\naccord  ing to factorial margins (table 3). The risk differ -\\nence and risk ratio of having at least one colorectal adenoma did not differ between EPA and placebo, and it also did not differ between aspirin and placebo (table 4; appendix). The 95% CI for the risk difference for both interventions did not exceed –10% (the absolute ADR difference that the trial was powered to detect). An analysis that was not \\nadjusted for repeat colonoscopy \\nshowed similar results (appendix). Multiple sensitivity analyses, including per-protocol analysis, were supportive of the primary analysis (appendix).Summary data for the number of colorectal adenomas \\ndetected at surveillance colonoscopy are shown in table 2 and in the appendix.

The total mean number of colorectal adenomas per participant was 1·4 (SD 2·0) in individuals who were allocated\\n \\nplacebo only, compared with 1·6 (2·1) for those allocated EPA and 1·3 (1·6) for those assigned to aspirin. Participants assigned to both EPA and aspirin had a mean of 1·0 (1·2) adenomas per person (table 2). Analysis at the margins revealed an IRR of 0·91 (95% CI 0·79–1·05) for EPA and 0·78 (95% CI 0·68–0·90) for aspirin (table 4).Secondary ADR outcomes are described in tables 2–4 \\nand in the appendix. Few advanced colorectal adenomas were detected (table 2). IRRs from an at-the-margins analysis of the mean number of adenomas per participant for colorectal adenoma subtypes showed an effect of EPA on left-sided and conventional colorectal adenomas, but no evidence of an effect on right-sided or serrated lesions was observed (table 3, 4, appendix). By contrast, aspirin treatment was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of conventional colorectal adenomas, but also a decrease in IRR for right-sided and serrated lesions (table 3, appendix). In keeping with the primary ADR outcome, no evidence of any difference in colorectal adenoma subtype ADRs for either EPA or aspirin was observed, except for a possible effect of EPA on recurrence of left-sided colorectal adenomas (table 4; appendix).

No colorectal cancers were detected during \\nthe seAFOod trial.\\nThe safety population comprised 697 participants who \\nreceived at least one dose of IMP (table 5). Overall, there were no safety concerns in participants receiving either EPA or aspirin (appendix). The majority of adverse events were mild in severity in each of the treatment groups (table 5). An excess of adverse events was observed in participants receiving EPA alone, adverse events that were predominantly gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and nausea; appendix) and were explained mainly by clustering of numerous gastrointestinal adverse events in a small number of individuals (table 5). By contrast, the frequency and distribution of gastrointestinal adverse events was similar across the other three groups, including those who received both EPA and aspirin (table 5; appendix). No consistent differences in gastro\\n intestinal adverse \\nevents between individuals receiving EPA–FFA or EPA–triglyceride were observed (appendix). The same pattern was noted for adverse drug reactions (appendix). A small number of serious adverse events (SAEs)\\n \\nwere reported (table 5; appendix). The most frequently reported SAEs were cardiac events (including three episodes of atrial fibrillation in one participant and one atrial fibrillation episode in two participants, all of whom were receiving EPA alone) and gastrointestinal disorders. No haemorrhagic strokes were reported. Six acute upper-gastrointestinal bleeding events were reported, and were spread across the treatment groups (two in the EPA group, three in the aspirin group, and one in the placebo group). One unrelated death in the placebo group was reported after 9 months of intervention (bladder cancer).\\nNo evidence of a difference in colorectal adenoma size \\nassociated with either EPA or aspirin use was found (appendix).\\nFinally, the detailed PUFA measurements done to com\\n-\\npare tissue EPA incorporation during dosing with EPA–FFA and EPA–triglyceride provided an \\nopportunity to \\nexplore the relationship between target organ (rectal) EPA incorporation and red blood cell EPA levels commonly used as a biomarker of tissue EPA exposure.\\n18 \\nA moderate strength correlation (r=0·455) between red blood cell and rectal mucosal EPA con\\n centrations was \\nobserved at 12 months (appendix). We also did an unplanned investigation of the re\\n lationship between \\nindividual rectal mucosal EPA concentration and number of colorectal adenomas (total and subtypes) descriptively, comparing EPA users and those who received \\nplacebo EPA (appendix). Both EPA users and \\nthose who did not use EPA with a higher rectal mucosal EPA concentration appeared to have, in general, a lower colorectal adenoma count than those with a lower rectal mucosal EPA level, which was most marked for total colorectal adenoma number and conventional adenomas (appendix).Discussion\\nThe seAFOod Polyp Prevention trial found no evidence of an effect of either EPA or aspirin on the primary outcome of the proportion of individuals with one or more colorectal adenomas at 12 month surveillance colonoscopy (the ADR) in patients defined as high risk by the English BCSP. However, secondary analyses of the effects of EPA and aspirin on colorectal adenoma number provided evidence of the chemopreventive activity of both agents. Aspirin was effective at reducing the total number of colorectal adenomas per participant, but the effect of EPA on total number of adenomas per participant was insufficiently precise to draw a firm conclusion about efficacy. Other secondary analyses suggested that EPA and aspirin have colorectal adenoma subtype-selective and site-selective effects. Participants randomly assigned to receive EPA had a reduced total number of and ADR for conventional adenomas in the left colorectum than did those in the placebo group. As well as a reduction in total colorectal adenoma number, participants randomly assigned to receive aspirin had a reduced number of adenomas in the right colon, particularly for serrated adenomas, but also a reduced risk of conventional colorectal adenomas.\\nThe ADR was chosen as the primary outcome because \\nprevious polyp prevention trials have used this binary EPA vs no EPA Aspirin vs no aspirin\\nAll colorectal adenomas\\nRisk difference (95% CI)* –0·9% (–8·8 to 6·9); \\np=0·81–0·6% (–8·5 to 7·2); \\np=0·88\\nRisk ratio (95% CI)* 0·98 (0·87 to 1·12) 0·99 (0·87 to 1·12)\\nIRR (95% CI) 0·91 (0·79 to 1·05) 0·78 (0·68 to 0·90)\\nAdvanced colorectal adenomas\\nRisk difference (95% CI) –0·6% (–4·4 to 3·1) –0·3% (–4·1 to 3·5)\\nIRR (95% CI) 0·82 (0·43 to 1·56) 0·99 (0·52 to 1·86)\\nConventional colorectal adenomasRisk difference (95% CI) –3·3% (–11·2 to 4·7) 1·7% (–6·2 to 9·6)\\nIRR (95% CI) 0·86 (0·74 to 0·99) 0·82 (0·71 to 0·94)\\nSerrated colorectal adenomasRisk difference (95% CI) 0% (–3·2 to 3·2) –2·7% (–6·1 to 0·7)\\nIRR (95% CI) 1·44 (0·79 to 2·60) 0·46 (0·25 to 0·87)\\nLeft-sided colorectal adenomasRisk difference (95% CI) –7·8% (–15·5 to –0·2) –1·8% (–9·4 to 5·8)\\nIRR (95% CI) 0·75 (0·60 to 0·94) 0·85 (0·69 to 1·06)\\nRight-sided colon adenomasRisk difference (95% CI) 6·0% (–1·9 to 13·9) –3·1% (–11·0 to 4·7)\\nIRR (95% CI) 1·02 (0·85 to 1·22) 0·73 (0·61 to 0·88)\\nParticipants reclassified as intermediate riskRisk difference (95% CI) –0·2% (–5·4 to 5·1) 0·9% (–14·1 to 6·2)\\nEPA=eicosapentaenoic acid. *Adjusted by site as random effect and repeat \\ncolonoscopy at baseline, n=588 (152 in the placebo group, 138 in the EPA group, 147 in the aspirin group, and 151 in the EPA plus aspirin group).\\nTable 4: Comparison of the adenoma detection rate and adenoma \\nnumber for the primary and secondary colorectal adenoma outcomes ', metadata={'source': './articles\\\\389e08a4394a7b5dc18d61e575bb3a2fe62d50d4.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='Articles10 www.thelancet.com   Published online November 19, 2018   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ S0140-6736(18)31775-6measure of colorectal adenoma occurrence as the \\nprimary endpoint.12 The high ADR (61%) in the placebo \\ngroup in patients who were high risk so-called polyp formers was anticipated,\\n21 but is higher than that \\nobserved in previous polyp prevention trials that included a majority of patients at intermediate risk.

The seAFOod trial data concur with evidence from long-term follow-up of vascular RCTs that show that reduction in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality with aspirin is explained by an effect on proximal neoplasia, with less preventive efficacy against distal colorectal cancer.\\n13 Two observational studies \\nalready support a beneficial effect of aspirin on serrated polyp risk.\\n26,27 The seAFOod trial data should prompt a \\nparadigm shift towards stratified chemoprevention trials with analysis of colorectal adenoma subtype and tumour location outcomes. Differential preventive activity against conventional and serrated pathway lesions by EPA and aspirin has highlighted the relatively poor characterisation of the molecular phenotype of colorectal adenomas compared with colorectal cancer,\\n7,9 and the poor under -\\nstanding of the mechanism of action of both agents. Subsequent mechanistic studies of EPA and aspirin should investigate differential activity \\nin models of \\nchromosomal instability, microsatellite instability, and CIMP carcinogenesis pathways.\\nTotal and left-sided colorectal adenoma multiplicity \\nwas lower in the group receiving combined treatment with EPA and aspirin, consistent with efficacy of both agents on left-sided, conventional colorectal adenomas.

Despite self-reported compliance being excellent by capsule counting, the increase in EPA concentrations in red blood cells observed in active EPA users was highly variable, a phenomenon which has been seen in previous omega-3 PUFA studies.\\n30 Detailed analysis of the relation -\\nship between individual baseline omega-3 PUFA concentrations, dietary omega-3 PUFA intake, and response to EPA dosing versus colorectal adenoma number is now required.\\nNo evidence of substantial conversion of EPA to \\ndocosahexaenoic acid either in red blood cell membranes or rectal mucosa was seen. Therefore, the trial data do not support EPA as a universal omega-3 PUFA donor in the colorectum and no conclusions can be drawn from the trial about the efficacy of mixed EPA and docosahexaenoic acid formulations, which represent the majority of prescription and nutritional supplement omega-3 PUFA formulations.\\nStrengths of the trial include \\nexcellent, quality-assured \\ncolonoscopy performance and histological reporting, and uniform, protocol-driven care in the BCSP.\\n2,22 We chose \\nto study a high-risk surveillance cohort to reduce study duration and costs. We have previously justified the use of a 1 year endpoint on the basis of positive findings at 1 year colonoscopy that mirror longer follow-up in previous aspirin polyp prevention trials,\\n12 and evidence \\nthat colorectal adenoma outcomes after 1 year represent de-novo adenoma growth rather than solely missed lesions.\\n17 The low number of advanced colorectal \\nadenomas detected compared with previous RCTs is a limitation and probably relates to the short surveillance interval and the completeness of clearance of the screening colonoscopy in the BCSP. The male pre\\n-\\ndominance reflects actual screening practice in the UK, as does the high prevalence of excess bodyweight in those with high-risk neoplasia.\\n2 The trial only reached \\n83% of its recruitment target due primarily to a high screening failure, which included a higher-than-expected number of individuals who were unwilling to provide consent after BCSP screening. This finding has imp\\n-\\nortant implications for acceptability of long-term chemo -\\nprevention, even in high-risk cohorts, which requires further behavioural research. However\\n, the reduced \\nsample size still yielded sufficient precision to exclude a prespecified difference of 10% from placebo in the ADR for both EPA and aspirin.\\nIn conclusion, the seAFOod Polyp Prevention trial has \\nshown that the omega-3 PUFA EPA (2 g FFA per day) and aspirin (300 mg per day) did not reduce colorectal adenoma risk (as measured by the proportion of partici\\n-\\npants with at least one adenoma) at 1 year surveillance colonoscopy in individuals at high risk with colorectal neoplasia in the English BCSP. However, both agents had some chemopreventive efficacy \\non colorectal \\nadenoma burden, as measured by a reduction in the mean number of adenomas per participant. The colo\\n-\\nrectal adenoma subtype-dependent and location-de -\\npendent specificity of EPA and aspirin are consistent with previous observations. Existing data \\non colorectal \\ncancer risk reduction by aspirin suggest that the decrease in colorectal adenoma recurrence that we report for both agents is likely to translate into a clinically meaningful decrease in long-term colorectal cancer risk.\\nContributors\\nMAH was chief investigator.

The primary composite outcome was myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes.\\nRESULTS\\nAt 1 year, the mean systolic blood pressure was 121.4 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group and 136.2 mm Hg in the standard-treatment group. The interven -\\ntion was stopped early after a median follow-up of 3.26 years owing to a signifi -\\ncantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (1.65% per year vs. 2.19% per year; hazard ratio with intensive treatment, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.89; P<0.001). All-cause mortality was also significantly lower in the intensive-treatment group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.90; P = 0.003). Rates of seri -\\nous adverse events of hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury or failure, but not of injurious falls, were higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nAmong patients at high risk for cardiovascular events but without diabetes, target -\\ning a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with less than 140 mm Hg, resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause, although significantly higher rates of some adverse events were observed in the intensive-treatment group.

Observational studies have shown a progressive increase in cardiovascular risk as systolic blood pressure rises above 115 mm Hg,\\n10 \\nbut the available evidence from randomized, controlled trials in the general population of patients with hypertension only documents the benefit of treatment to achieve a systolic blood-pressure target of less than 150 mm Hg, with limited data concerning lower blood-pressure targets.\\n11,17-21 In a trial involving patients with \\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus, the rate of major cardio -\\nvascular events was similar with a systolic blood-pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg and the commonly recommended target of less than 140 mm Hg, though the rate of stroke was lower with the target of less than 120 mm Hg.\\n22 \\nA recent trial involving patients who had had a stroke compared treatment to lower systolic blood pressure to less than 130 mm Hg with treatment to lower it to less than 150 mm Hg and showed no significant benefit of the lower target with respect to the overall risk of another stroke but a significant benefit with respect to the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.\\n23\\nThe hypothesis that a lower systolic blood-\\npressure goal (e.g., <120 mm Hg) would reduce clinical events more than a standard goal was designated by a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) expert panel in 2007 as the most important hypothesis to test regarding the prevention of hypertension-related complications among patients without diabetes.24 The current \\narticle describes the primary results of the Sys -\\ntolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), which compared the benefit of treatment of systolic blood pressure to a target of less than 120 mm Hg with treatment to a target of less than 140 mm Hg.\\nMethods\\nStudy Design and Oversight\\nSPRINT was a randomized, controlled, open-la -\\nbel trial that was conducted at 102 clinical sites (organized into 5 clinical center networks) in the United States, including Puerto Rico (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). A trial coordi -\\nnating center served as a data and biostatistical core center and supervised the central laboratory, the electrocardiography reading center, the mag -\\nnetic resonance imaging reading center, and the drug-distribution center. The rationale and pro -\\ntocol for the trial are publicly available,\\n25,26 and \\nthe protocol is available at NEJM.org.\\nSPRINT was sponsored by the NHLBI, with \\ncosponsorship by the National Institute of Dia -\\nbetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the National Institute on Aging. An independent data and safety monitoring board monitored unblinded trial results and safety events. The study was approved by the institu -\\ntional review board at each participating study site. The steering committee designed the study, gathered the data (in collaboration with investi -\\ngators at the clinics and other study units), made the decision to submit the manuscript for publi -\\ncation, and vouches for the fidelity of the study to the protocol. The writing committee wrote the manuscript and vouches for the complete -\\nness and accuracy of the data and analysis. The coordinating center was responsible for analyz -\\ning the data.

Increased cardiovascu -\\nlar risk was defined by one or more of the fol -\\nlowing: clinical or subclinical cardiovascular dis -\\nease other than stroke; chronic kidney disease, \\nexcluding polycystic kidney disease, with an esti -\\nmated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20 to less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m\\n2 of body-\\nsurface area, calculated with the use of the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation; a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 15% or greater on the basis of the Framing -\\nham risk score; or an age of 75 years or older. Patients with diabetes mellitus or prior stroke were excluded. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the Supplementary Appen -\\ndix. All participants provided written informed consent.\\nRandomization and Interventions\\nEligible participants were assigned to a sys -\\ntolic blood-pressure target of either less than 140 mm Hg (the standard-treatment group) or less than 120 mm Hg (the intensive-treatment group). Randomization was stratified according to clinical site. Participants and study personnel were aware of the study-group assignments, but outcome adjudicators were not.\\nAfter the participants underwent randomiza -\\ntion, their baseline antihypertensive regimens were adjusted on the basis of the study-group assignment. The treatment algorithms were sim -\\nilar to those used in the Action to Control Car -\\ndiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial.\\n22 \\nThese algorithms and our formulary are listed in Figures S1 and S2 and Table S1 in the Supple -\\nmentary Appendix. All major classes of antihy -\\npertensive agents were included in the formulary and were provided at no cost to the participants. SPRINT investigators could also prescribe other antihypertensive medications (not provided by the study). The protocol encouraged, but did not mandate, the use of drug classes with the stron -\\ngest evidence for reduction in cardiovascular outcomes, including thiazide-type diuretics (en -\\ncouraged as the first-line agent), loop diuretics (for participants with advanced chronic kidney disease), and beta-adrenergic blockers (for those with coronary artery disease).\\n5,27 Chlorthalidone \\nwas encouraged as the primary thiazide-type di -\\nuretic, and amlodipine as the preferred calcium-channel blocker.\\n28,29 Azilsartan and azilsartan \\ncombined with chlorthalidone were donated by Takeda Pharmaceuticals International and Arbor Pharmaceuticals; neither company had any other role in the study.\\nParticipants were seen monthly for the first \\n3 months and every 3 months thereafter. Medi -\\ncations for participants in the intensive-treat -\\nment group were adjusted on a monthly basis to target a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg. For participants in the standard-treatment group, medications were adjusted to target a systolic blood pressure of 135 to 139 mm Hg, and the dose was reduced if sys -\\ntolic blood pressure was less than 130 mm Hg on a single visit or less than 135 mm Hg on two consecutive visits. Dose adjustment was based on a mean of three blood-pressure measure -\\nments at an office visit while the patient was seated and after 5 minutes of quiet rest; the measurements were made with the use of an automated measurement system (Model 907, Omron Healthcare). Lifestyle modification was encouraged as part of the management strategy. Retention in the study and adherence to treat -\\nment were monitored prospectively and routinely throughout the trial.\\n26\\nStudy Measurements\\nDemographic data were collected at baseline. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. A struc -\\ntured interview was used in both groups every 3 months to obtain self-reported cardiovascular disease outcomes. Although the interviewers were aware of the study-group assignments, they used the same format for interviews in the two groups to minimize ascertainment bias. Medical records and electrocardiograms were obtained for documentation of events. Whenever clinical-site staff became aware of a death, a standard protocol was used to obtain information on the event.\\nSerious adverse events were defined as events \\nthat were fatal or life-threatening, that resulted in clinically significant or persistent disability, that required or prolonged a hospitalization, or that were judged by the investigator to represent a clinically significant hazard or harm to the participant that might require medical or surgi -\\ncal intervention to prevent one of the other events listed above.\\n30,31 A short list of monitored \\nconditions were reported as adverse events if they were evaluated in an emergency department: \\nThe New England Journal of Medicine \\nDownloaded from nejm.org on November 19, 2018.

We also moni -\\ntored occurrences of acute kidney injury or acute renal failure if they were noted on admission or occurred during a hospitalization and were re -\\nported in the hospital discharge summary as a primary or main secondary diagnosis. The Medi -\\ncal Dictionary for Regulatory Activities was used to classify the safety events. Coding was performed at the coordinating center, and up to three codes were assigned to each safety event. The relation -\\nship of serious adverse events to the intervention was assessed by the trial safety officer and re -\\nviewed monthly by the safety committee.\\nStudy Outcomes\\nDefinitions of study outcomes are outlined in the Supplementary Appendix. A committee whose members were unaware of the study-group as -\\nsignments adjudicated the clinical outcomes specified in the protocol. The primary hypothe -\\nsis was that treatment to reach a systolic blood-pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with a target of less than 140 mm Hg, would result in a lower rate of the composite outcome of myocardial infarction, acute coro -\\nnary syndrome not resulting in myocardial in -\\nfarction, stroke, acute decompensated heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary composite outcome, death from any cause, and the composite of the primary outcome or death from any cause.\\nWe also assessed renal outcomes, using a dif -\\nferent definition for patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR <60 ml per minute per 1.73 m\\n2) at \\nbaseline and those without it. The renal outcome in participants with chronic kidney disease at baseline was a composite of a decrease in the eGFR of 50% or more (confirmed by a subse -\\nquent laboratory test) or the development of ESRD requiring long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation. In participants without chronic kidney disease at baseline, the renal outcome was defined by a decrease in the eGFR of 30% or more to a value of less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m\\n2. Incident albuminuria, defined for \\nall study participants by a doubling of the ratio of urinary albumin (in milligrams) to creatinine (in grams) from less than 10 at baseline to greater than 10 during follow-up, was also a prespecified renal outcome.Prespecified subgroups of interest for all out -\\ncomes were defined according to status with re -\\nspect to cardiovascular disease at baseline (yes vs. no), status with respect to chronic kidney disease at baseline (yes vs. no), sex, race (black vs. non -\\nblack), age (<75 vs. ≥75 years), and baseline sys -\\ntolic blood pressure in three levels (≤132 mm Hg, >132 to <145 mm Hg, and ≥145 mm Hg). We also planned a comparison of the effects of systolic blood-pressure targets on incident de -\\nmentia, changes in cognitive function, and cere -\\nbral small-vessel ischemic disease; these results are not presented here.\\nStatistical Analysis\\nWe planned a 2-year recruitment period, with a maximum follow-up of 6 years, and anticipated a loss to follow-up of 2% per year. With an en -\\nrollment target of 9250 participants, we estimated that the trial would have 88.7% power to detect a 20% effect with respect to the primary out -\\ncome, assuming an event rate of 2.2% per year in the standard-treatment group.\\nOur primary analysis compared the time to \\nthe first occurrence of a primary outcome event between the two study groups with the use of the intention-to-treat approach for all randomly assigned participants; for this analysis, we used Cox proportional-hazards regression with two-sided tests at the 5% level of significance, with stratification according to clinic. Follow-up time was censored on the date of last event ascertain -\\nment. Interactions between treatment effect and prespecified subgroups were assessed with a likelihood-ratio test for the interaction with the use of Hommel-adjusted P values.\\n32 Interim \\nanalyses were performed for each meeting of the data and safety monitoring board, with group-sequential stopping boundaries defined with the use of the Lan–DeMets method with an O’Brien–Fleming–type spending function.\\n33 The Fine–\\nGray model for the competing risk of death was used as a sensitivity analysis.\\n34\\nResults\\nStudy Participants\\nA total of 9361 participants were enrolled be -\\ntween November 2010 and March 2013 (Fig. 1).

The median follow-up on August 20, 2015, was 3.26 years of the planned average of 5 years.\\nBlood Pressure\\nThe two treatment strategies resulted in a rapid and sustained between-group difference in sys -\\ntolic blood pressure ( Fig. 2). At 1 year, the mean \\nsystolic blood pressure was 121.4 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group and 136.2 mm Hg in the standard-treatment group, for an average difference of 14.8 mm Hg. The mean diastolic blood pressure at 1 year was 68.7 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group and 76.3 mm Hg in the standard-treatment group (Fig. S4 in the Supple -\\nmentary Appendix). Throughout the 3.26 years of follow-up, the mean systolic blood pressure was 121.5 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group and 134.6 mm Hg in the standard-treat -\\nment group, and the mean number of blood-pressure medications was 2.8 and 1.8, respec -\\ntively. The relative distribution of antihypertensive medication classes used was similar in the two groups, though the use of each class was greater in the intensive-treatment group (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\\nClinical Outcomes\\nA primary outcome event was confirmed in 562 participants — 243 (1.65% per year) in the inten -\\nsive-treatment group and 319 (2.19% per year) in the standard-treatment group (hazard ratio with intensive treatment, 0.75; 95% confidence inter -\\nval [CI], 0.64 to 0.89; P<0.001) (Table 2). Separa -\\ntion in the primary outcome between the groups was apparent at 1 year (Fig. 3A). The between-group differences were consistent across the components of the primary outcome and other prespecified secondary outcomes (Table  2).\\nA total of 365 deaths occurred — 155 in the \\nintensive-treatment group and 210 in the stan -\\ndard-treatment group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.90; P = 0.003). Separation in mortality \\nbetween the groups became apparent at ap -\\nproximately 2 years (Fig. 3B). Causes of death are provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap -pendix. The relative risk of death from cardiovas -\\ncular causes was 43% lower with the intensive intervention than with the standard treatment (P = 0.005) (Table 2).\\nThe numbers needed to treat to prevent a \\nprimary outcome event, death from any cause, and death from cardiovascular causes during the median 3.26 years of the trial were 61, 90, and 172, respectively. The effects of the intervention on the rate of the primary outcome and on the rate of death from any cause were consistent across the prespecified subgroups (Fig. 4, and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were no significant interactions between treat -\\nment and subgroup with respect to the primary outcome or death from any cause. When death Figure 1.

A total of 220 participants in the intensive-treatment group (4.7%) and 118 participants in the standard-treatment group (2.5%) had serious adverse events that were classified as possibly or defi -\\nnitely related to the intervention (hazard ratio, 1.88; P<0.001) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The magnitude and pattern of differ -\\nences in adverse events according to treatment assignment among participants 75 years of age or older were similar to those in the overall co -\\nhort (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\\nDiscussion\\nSPRINT showed that among adults with hyperten -\\nsion but without diabetes, lowering systolic blood pressure to a target goal of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with the standard goal of less than 140 mm Hg, resulted in significantly lower rates of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and death from any cause. Trial participants as -\\nsigned to the lower systolic blood-pressure target (intensive-treatment group), as compared with those assigned to the higher target (standard-treatment group), had a 25% lower relative risk of the primary outcome; in addition, the inten -\\nsive-treatment group had lower rates of several other important outcomes, including heart fail -\\nure (38% lower relative risk), death from cardio -\\nvascular causes (43% lower relative risk), and death from any cause (27% lower relative risk). During the follow-up period of the trial (median, 3.26 years), the number needed to treat with a strategy of intensive blood-pressure control to prevent one primary outcome event was 61, and the number needed to treat to prevent one death CharacteristicIntensive Treatment \\n(N = 4678)Standard Treatment \\n(N = 4683)\\nBody\\xadmass index‖ 29.9±5.8 29.8±5.7\\nAntihypertensive agents — no./patient 1.8±1.0 1.8±1.0\\nNot using antihypertensive agents — no.

These benefits with re -\\nspect to both the primary outcome and death \\nwere consistent across all prespecified subgroups, including participants 75 years of age or older.\\nOwing in part to a lower-than-expected de -\\ncline in the eGFR and to the early termination of the trial, the number of renal events was small. Among participants who had chronic kidney disease at baseline, the number of participants with a decrease in the eGFR of 50% or more or reaching ESRD over the course of the trial did not differ significantly between the two interven -\\ntion groups. Among participants who did not have chronic kidney disease at baseline, a decrease in the eGFR of 30% or more to a value of less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m\\n2 occurred more \\nfrequently in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (1.21% per year vs. 0.35% per year). Among all participants, acute kidney injury or acute renal failure occurred more frequently in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (Table 3, and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The differences in adverse renal outcomes may be related to a reversible intrarenal hemody -\\nnamic effect of the greater reduction in blood pressure and greater use of diuretics, angioten -\\nsin-converting–enzyme inhibitors, and angio -\\ntensin-receptor blockers in the intensive-treat -\\nment group.\\n35,36 With the currently available data, \\nthere is no evidence of substantial permanent kidney injury associated with the lower systolic blood-pressure goal; however, the possibility of a long-term adverse renal outcome cannot be ex -\\ncluded.

The ACCORD trial showed a (nonsignificant) 12% lower risk of its primary composite cardiovascular out -\\ncome, with a 95% confidence interval that in -\\ncluded the possibility of a 27% lower risk, which is consistent with the cardiovascular benefit observed in SPRINT. The ACCORD trial also used a factorial design that included compari -sons of standard and intensive glycemic and lipid treatment targets in the same trial. A sec -\\nondary analysis of the ACCORD results showed that, as compared with the combined standard glycemia and blood-pressure treatments, inten -\\nsive blood-pressure treatment alone reduced ma -\\njor cardiovascular outcomes by 26% without additional benefit from combining the two in -\\ntensive treatments.\\n38 Thus, the difference in re -\\nsults between the trials could be due to differ -\\nences in study design, treatment interactions, or the play of chance. An inherent difference in the cardiovascular benefits of systolic blood-pressure lowering between the population with diabetes and the population without diabetes seems un -\\nlikely but cannot be ruled out.\\nIn the Secondary Prevention of Small Sub -\\ncortical Strokes trial (intensive systolic blood-pressure goal <130 mm Hg)\\n23 and in the \\n ACCORD trial (intensive systolic blood-pressure \\ngoal <120 mm Hg), the lower blood-pressure target was associated with a nonsignificant 19% lower incidence of stroke (P = 0.08) and a signifi -\\ncant 41% lower incidence of stroke, respectively, than the incidence with higher targets. The intensive-treatment group in SPRINT had a non -\\nsignificant 11% lower incidence of stroke, though SPRINT also excluded persons with prevalent stroke or transient ischemic attack at baseline.\\nIn SPRINT, significant between-group differ -\\nences were noted in some adverse effects that were attributed to the intervention (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Orthostatic hypo -\\ntension as assessed during a clinic visit (Table 3) was observed less frequently in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (P = 0.01), but syncope was more common \\namong participants in the intensive-treatment group than among those in the standard-treat -\\nment group (3.5% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.003), as was \\nhypotension (3.4% vs. 2.0%, P<0.001). There was no between-group difference in injurious falls (hazard ratio, 1.00; P = 0.97). There was a higher \\nrate of acute kidney injury or acute renal failure in the intensive-treatment group, as noted above. These adverse events need to be weighed against the benefits with respect to cardiovascular events and death that are associated with intensive con -\\ntrol of systolic blood pressure.\\nThe strengths of SPRINT include a large \\nsample size, the diversity of the population Figure 3.

The lack of generalizability to popula -\\ntions not included in the study — such as per -\\nsons with diabetes, those with prior stroke, and those younger than 50 years of age — is a limi -\\ntation. It is also worth noting that we did not enroll older adults residing in nursing homes or assisted-living facilities. In addition, the effects of the lower blood pressure on the central ner -\\nvous system and kidney cannot be reasonably interpreted until analysis of these end points has been completed.\\nThe SPRINT results raise important practical \\nissues. Hypertension control to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg is achieved in only about 50% of the general population in the United States, which suggests that control to even that level is challenging.\\n39 We excluded patients with more severe hypertension, and control of systolic blood pressure to less than 120 mm Hg required, on average, one additional antihyper -\\ntensive drug. In addition, the median systolic blood pressure in the intensive-treatment group was just above 120 mm Hg, which indicates that more than half the participants had a systolic blood pressure above the 120 mm Hg target. These observations suggest that achieving a sys -\\ntolic blood-pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg in the overall population of patients with hypertension would be more demanding and time-consuming for both providers and patients than achieving a goal of 140 mm Hg, and would necessitate increased medication costs and clin -\\nic visits.\\nIn conclusion, targeting a systolic blood pres -\\nsure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with less than 140 mm Hg, in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events but without diabetes re -\\nsulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major Figure 4.

      "[Document(page_content='   1BISOPROLOL DANS L’INSUFFISANCE CARDIAQUE:  \\nESSAI RANDOMISE CIBIS II \\n \\nIntroduction \\nDes études expérimentales et des essais cliniques \\nont montré un bénéfice du traitement bêtabloquant \\ndans l’insuffisance cardiaque (1,2). Cependant il \\nexiste des réticences à utiliser le traitement bêtabloquant et il est nécessaire de disposer d’un \\nessai contrôlé randomisé contre placebo pour \\nconvaincre la communauté médicale de sa sécurité d’emploi et de son efficacité. \\nLes méta-analyses des essais contrôlés contre \\nplacebo des bêtabloquants ont suggéré qu’ils diminuent la mortalité d’environ 32 % (2-6). \\nL’étude du bisoprolol dans l’insuffisance cardiaque \\n(CIBIS) a évalué le bisoprolol, un antagoniste sélectif des récepteurs bêta-adrénergiques qui sont \\nretrouvés principalement dans le cœur et \\nparticulièrement dans le tissu ventriculaire (7). Cet essai n’a montré qu’une tendance non significative \\nen faveur d’une diminution de 20 % de la mortalité \\ndans le groupe bisoprolol et une diminution de 30 \\n% du nombre d’admissions à l’hôpital pour \\naggravation de l’insuffisance cardiaque (8). Nous avons donc conçu l’essai CIBIS II pour confirmer \\nles résultats de l’étude CIBIS. \\n \\nMéthode \\nLe schéma de l’étude et le protocole de CIBIS ont \\ndéjà été publiés (9). Nous avons réalisé un essai en double aveugle contre placebo randomisé avec \\nanalyse en intention de traiter. \\n Patients \\nLes patients éligibles étaient des sujets âgés de 18 à \\n80 ans, ambulatoires qui avaient une fraction d’éjection ventriculaire gauche inférieure ou égale à \\n35% dans les 6 semaines précédant la \\nrandomisation. Les symptômes devaient inclure une dyspnée d’effort, une orthopnée ou une dyspnée \\nnocturne avec ou sans œdème et une asthénie \\ncorrespondant à la classe III ou IV de la New York \\nHeart Association (NYHA). Nous avons recruté des \\npatients de 274 hôpitaux dans 18 pays de l’Europe de l’Est et de l’Ouest. Les patients devaient avoir \\nun diagnostic d’insuffisance cardiaque chronique \\nfait au moins 3 mois avant, avec une stabilité clinique durant les 6 semaines précédentes pour \\nl’insuffisance cardiaque ou les 3 mois pour \\nl’infarctus du myocarde ou l’angor instable. Le traitement cardiovasculaire devait ne pas avoir été \\nmodifié pendant les 2 semaines précédant la \\nrandomisation. Le traitement devait inclure un diurétique et un inhibiteur de l’enzyme de \\nconversion de l’angiotensine (IEC) quoique nous \\nayons autorisé l’usage des vasodilatateurs si les patients étaient intolérants aux IEC. L’utilisation de \\nla Digoxine était possible. Nous avons mesuré la \\nfraction d’éjection ventriculaire gauche par échocardiographie avec la formule de Teicholz en \\nutilisant des enregistrements en mode M ou la formule de Simpson modifiée pour les mesures des \\nvolumes télédiastoliques et télésystoliques sur des \\nvues apicales en 2 dimensions. Quand des coupes adéquates ne pouvaient être obtenues par \\néchocardiographie, nous avons utilisé la \\nventriculographie de contraste ou la ventriculographie isotopique. \\n \\nLes critères d’exclusion principaux étaient une \\nhypertension artérielle non contrôlée, un infarctus \\ndu myocarde ou un angor instable datant de moins \\nde 3 mois, une angioplastie coronaire percutanée ou un pontage aortocoronaire au cours des 6 mois \\nprécédents, un antécédent de transplantation \\ncardiaque ou une transplantation cardiaque programmée, un bloc atrioventriculaire de degré \\nsupérieur au premier degré sans stimulateur \\npermanent, une fréquence cardiaque de  repos de \\nmoins de 60 par minute, une pression artérielle \\nsystolique de repos de moins de 100 mmHg, une insuffisance rénale (créatinine sérique supérieure ou \\négale à 300 µmol/L), une maladie pulmonaire \\nobstructive ou un traitement bêtabloquant préexistant ou programmé. Nous n’avons pas \\nautorisé les traitements par bêtabloquant (incluant \\nles collyres), les antagonistes calciques, les agents inotropes à l’exception des digitaliques et les \\nantiarythmiques autres que la Cordarone pendant \\ncet essai. Nous avons identifié 3 groupes étiologiques qui \\ns’excluaient : les patients avec une maladie \\ncardiaque ischémique comportant au moins une sténose coronaire supérieure ou égale à 70 % à \\nl’angiographie ou un an técédent d’infarctus du \\nmyocarde ; les patients avec une cardiopathie dilatée s’ils avaient des ar tères coronaires normales \\nsur la coronarographie ; les patients avec une \\nmaladie valvulaire ou une hypertension ou une \\nsuspicion de maladie ischémique cardiaque sans \\nconfirmation ou une suspicion de cardiomyopathie sans confirmation. \\n \\nMéthode La randomisation a été réalisée à partir de nombres \\nau hasard générés par ordinateur dans le centre de \\nstatistiques indépendant et envoyée au centre participant à l’étude par fax. Le code était conservé \\ndans le centre d’études statistiques et n’était pas \\nouvert avant l’arrêt de l’étude. Les formes galleniques de l’étude avaient le même \\naspect. Les patients ont commencé sous bisoprolol \\n1,25 mg/j (N = 1327) ou  sous placebo (N = 1320), \\nla dose du médicament étant augmentée à 2,5 mg, \\n3,75 mg, 5 mg, 7,5 mg, 10 mg en fonction de la \\ntolérance. La dose était augmentée par paliers d’une ', metadata={'source': './articles\\\\536f5c87da0ddda9754dea62a5ea86e9afc6f248.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='   2semaine  pour les 3 doses les plus basses et par \\npaliers de 4 semaines pour les doses plus élevées. \\nLes investigateurs devaient s’assurer que la dose la plus élevée tolérée était atteinte et maintenue si \\npossible pendant toute la durée de l’essai. Chez les \\npatients avec aggravation de l’insuffisance cardiaque, nous avons recommandé d’augmenter \\ndans un premier temps le traitement de base de \\nl’insuffisance cardiaque avant de diminuer la dose du médicament à l’étude. Nous avons suivi tous les \\n3 mois jusqu’à la fin de l’étude tous les patients \\nchez lesquels on avait arrêté le traitement de l’étude. Il n’y a pas eu de période d’observation \\npréalable (« run in »). Le critère primaire était la \\nmortalité toutes causes. Les critères d’évaluation secondaires étaient les admissions à l’hôpital pour \\ntoutes causes, la mortalité cardiovasculaire, la \\nmortalité cardiovasculaire associée aux hospitalisations pour raisons cardiovasculaires et \\nl’arrêt prématuré et permanent du traitement. Tous \\nles évènements importants ont été analysés par le \\nComité des évènements critiques dans l’ignorance \\ndes traitements attribués. Ils ont classé tous les évènements selon des définitions strictes dont les \\nplus importantes sont données dans les lignes \\nsuivantes. La mort subite était définie comme une mort \\nsurvenant dans un délai d’une heure sans \\naggravation préalable des symptômes de l’insuffisance cardiaque. Nous avons aussi compté \\nparmi les morts subites les morts survenues pendant \\nle sommeil. Nous avons, d’une manière générale, classé les morts sans témoin comme d’origine \\ninconnue. Nous avons cla ssé comme défaillance de \\nla fonction contractile, les morts consécutives à une détérioration progressive de l’insuffisance \\ncardiaque, à un œdème pulmonaire aigu ou à un \\nchoc cardiogénique. Nous avons classé comme morts d’origine non cardiovasculaire les morts pour \\nlesquels on pouvait exclure un événement \\ncardiovasculaire comme une cause de la mort. La mort était classée d’origine inconnue quand il n’y \\navait pas assez de preuve pour confirmer une \\norigine cardiovasculaire ou non. Nous avons \\nconsidéré qu’il y avait un arrêt permanent du \\ntraitement à l’étude dans les cas suivants : nécessité d’un traitement bêtabloquant, intolérance au \\ntraitement à l’étude, diminution de la dose du \\nmédicament à l’étude, arrêt temporaire du médicament à l’étude, intolérance à la première \\ndose et toutes les autres circonstances où le \\ntraitement à l’étude était arrêté de manière permanente. \\n \\nAnalyse statistique D’après les courbes de survie de l’étude CIBIS, \\nnous avons estimé que le taux de mortalité annuel \\nétait de l’ordre de 11,2 % dans le groupe placebo. Pour obtenir une diminution d’au moins 25% de la \\nmortalité dans le groupe bisoprolol sur un suivi minimal de un an et maximal de deux ans, nous \\navons calculé que pour un risque alpha de 5% et \\nune puissance de 95 %, nous avions besoin de recruter 2500 patients. \\n \\nFigure 1 : Schéma de l’étude \\nNous avons programmé deux analyses \\nintermédiaires à 2500 patients-années et à 5000 \\npatients-années. L’étude pouvait être arrêtée si on observait une différence significative dans la \\nmortalité toutes causes confondues entre les deux \\ngroupes, pour un seuil de p < 0,001 (test de log-rank bilatéral) (10). Nous avons réalisé des analyses \\nen intention de traiter. Nous avons effectué des \\ncourbes de Kaplan-Meïer pour la mortalité totale, et mesuré les différences entr e les deux groupes avec \\nle test du log-rank (délai du premier événement). \\nUn modèle de Cox a permis de calculer les hazard ratio et les intervalles de confiance à 95 %. Nous \\navons utilisé le test de Breslow-Day pour \\ndéterminer l’homogénéité des rapports de cotes \\n(odds ratio) entre les deux groupes, en fonction de \\nla classe NYHA et de la cause d’insuffisance cardiaque. Nous avons comparé les caractéristiques \\ninitiales des deux groupes en utilisant le test t de \\nStudent ou le test des rangs de Wilcoxon pour les variables continues, et un test exact de Fisher ou un \\nchi-2 pour les variables dichotomiques. \\nRésultats  : \\nDeux mille six cent quarante sept patients ont été \\ninclus dans l’étude, et suivis sur une période \\nmoyenne de 1,3 ans. Les caractéristiques initiales étaient similaires dans les deux groupes (Tableau \\n1). 2647 patients randomisés \\n1327 patients traités \\npar bisoprolol 1320 patients traités\\npar placebo \\n920 patients \\ntraités à la fin \\nde l’étude 981 patients \\ntraités à la fin \\nde l’étude • 372 patients \\ndécédés ou ayant interrompu le traitement\\n• 28 traitements \\ninterrompus \\nprécocement \\n• 1 perdu de vue • 305 patients \\ndécédés ou ayant interrompu le traitement\\n• 41 traitements \\ninterrompus \\nprécocement \\n• 5 perdus de vue ', metadata={'source': './articles\\\\536f5c87da0ddda9754dea62a5ea86e9afc6f248.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='   3L’essai a été arrêté prématurément parce que la \\nmortalité toutes causes confondues était \\nsignificativement plus basse dans le groupe bisoprolol que dans le gr oupe placebo (fig. 2). Dans \\nle groupe bisoprolol, 156 (11,8%) patients sont \\nmorts, contre 228 (17,3%) dans le groupe placebo (p < 0,0001). Le taux de mortalité annuel estimé \\nétait de 8,8 % dans le groupe bisoprolol, contre 13,2 \\n% dans le groupe placebo (hazard ratio : 0,66, IC à \\n95% : 0,54-0,81) (fig. 2). \\nIl y avait significativement moins de morts cardio-\\nvasculaires parmi les patients sous bisoprolol que chez ceux sous placebo (p = 0,0049).

Un \\nbénéfice a été également cons taté pour la morbidité \\névaluée par les hospitalisations toutes causes et en \\nparticulier pour aggravation de l’insuffisance \\ncardiaque. \\nLa taille de l’effet (diminution de 32 % du risque de \\nmort et d’hospitalisation pour insuffisance \\ncardiaque) est en accord avec les résultats des méta-analyses des précédents essais randomisés contre \\nplacebo (4). Nos résultats ont été obtenus chez des \\npatients déjà sous diurétiques et IEC, et chez des \\npatients non sélectionnés pour leur tolérance au \\nbisoprolol, puisque nous n’avions pas de période d’observation préalable. Les bénéfices ont été \\nobservés quelle que fût la cause de l’insuffisance cardiaque ou la classe NYHA. L’effet le plus \\nimportant était cependant observé chez des patients \\ninitialement en classe III NYHA, avec une cardiopathie ischémique. \\nEn incluant les résultats de cette étude, l’expérience \\ncumulée concernant les bêta-bloquants dans l’insuffisance cardiaque chronique (plus de 6000 \\npatients dans les essais randomisés) approche celle \\ndes IEC dans l’insuffisance cardiaque symptomatique (11). Des analyses post-hoc ont \\négalement suggéré l’in térêt d’ajouter un \\nbêtabloquant aux IEC après un infarctus du myocarde, mais cette stratégie n’a pas été étayée \\npar des essais randomisés de puissance suffisante \\npour une évaluation chez les patients avec dysfonction ventriculaire gauche avec ou sans \\ninsuffisance cardiaque (12). \\nLe bénéfice thérapeutique peut être expliqué par \\nl’inhibition  des effets potentiellement délétères des \\nmécanismes d’adaptation : le système rénine-\\nangiotensine-aldostérone pour les IEC et \\nl’hyperactivité sympathique pour les bêtabloquants. \\nLe travail cardiaque et la consommation d’énergie \\nsont diminués par la diminution de la charge par les \\nIEC et par la diminution de la fréquence cardiaque \\nsous bêtabloquant et la diminution de la pression artérielle avec les deux classes. Dans cette \\nexplication neuro-endocrine, les IEC inhibent \\négalement l’effet toxique dire ct de l’angiotensine II \\net de l’aldostérone et les bêta-bloquants préviennent \\nles effets toxiques directs des catécholamines. \\nL’effet le plus marqué sur la mortalité est la \\ndiminution de 42% des morts subites sous \\nbisoprolol associée à la diminution non significative \\nde morts par défaillance de la fonction pompe. Ce résultat suggère que le bisoprolol agissait \\nprincipalement comme antiarythmique plutôt qu’en \\nagissant sur la fonction myocardique. Etant donné ce qui est déjà connu sur les effets favorables des \\nbêtabloquants sur la fonction et la structure \\ncardiaques, la manière dont nous avons classé les causes de mort devrait être prise en compte. Les \\nmorts subites ou celles associées à la défaillance de \\nla fonction pompe avaient une définition stricte. En \\nconséquence, de nombreux dé cès ont dû être classés \\nde cause inconnue pour les besoins de l’étude. Les décès sans témoin ou sans documentation suffisante \\net classés de cause inco nnue étaient probablement \\nsubits et parmi eux certains pouvaient être dus à une défaillance de la pompe. De plus, le bisoprolol \\nétait responsable d’un nombre de morts \\nsignificativement plus bas dans le groupe de décès d’origine inconnue, ce qui plaide en faveur de ce \\nque la plupart des morts de cette catégorie étaient \\nd’origine cardiaque. Ces difficultés de classification étayent la valeur du critère « mortalité de toutes ', metadata={'source': './articles\\\\536f5c87da0ddda9754dea62a5ea86e9afc6f248.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='   6causes » comme le critère de jugement principal \\ndans des études similaires. \\nLa fréquence considérablement plus basse de morts \\nsubites chez les patients sous bisoprolol dans notre \\nétude suggère un effet antiarythmique important. \\nBien qu’une telle différence n’ait pas été observée dans l’étude CIBIS, une tendance semblable a été \\nobservée dans les études américaines sur le \\ncarvédilol (13). Dans CIBIS, la variabilité de la fréquence cardiaque dépendant du système vagal \\nétait plus élevée dans le groupe bisoprolol que dans \\nle groupe placebo, un effet qui a été corrélé à l’amélioration du pronostic après infarctus du \\nmyocarde et dans l’insuffisance cardiaque (14-17) . \\nCette constatation ainsi que le taux significativement plus bas d’hospitalisation pour \\ntachycardie ou fibrillation ventriculaires dans le \\ngroupe bisoprolol de CIBIS 2 est en faveur d’un effet potentiellement antiarythmique du \\nmédicament. \\nL’amélioration ou la préservation de la fonction \\nventriculaire gauche a pu aussi améliorer le \\npronostic à long terme (4,18). Une augmentation de la fraction d’éjection ventriculaire gauche qui peut \\nêtre dépendante de la dose a été observée avec \\nd’autres bêta-bloquants. Nous n’avons pas mesuré la fonction ventriculaire gauche de façon répétée, \\nmais dans l’étude CIBIS, l’amélioration du \\npronostic était significativement liée à l’augmentation de la fraction d’éjection \\nventriculaire gauche (19). Une méta-analyse des \\nétudes randomisées a montré une tendance à une meilleure survie avec les agents non sélectifs (4). \\nCe résultat était essentiellement  la conséquence de \\nla mortalité remarquablement plus basse observée dans les essais américains avec le carvédilol (8). En \\nthéorie le blocage des récepteurs adrénergiques bêta \\n1 et bêta 2 devrait conférer une protection plus complète contre les effets délétères des \\ncatécholamines mais nos résultats montrent que \\nl’inhibition sélective des récepteurs bêta 1 est suffisante pour diminuer la fréquence des morts \\nsubites possiblement associées aux arythmies. Les \\ndifférences d’effet en fonction des propriétés \\npharmacologiques des bêtabloquants sont \\nnéanmoins importantes et les essais en cours de \\nmédicaments comme le bucindolol, le carvédilol et \\nle métoprolol apporteront des renseignements \\nessentiels (20). \\nNous avons observé un bénéfice du bisoprolol chez \\ncertains patients en classe IV de la NYHA. \\nNéanmoins nous n’avons inclus que des patients stables et l’usage des bêta-bloquants chez des \\npatients non ambulatoires ayant des symptômes de \\nclasse IV, en particulier ceux avec une instabilité récente, doit être étudi é. L’adjonction d’un \\nbêtabloquant au traitement habituel avec un diurétique et un IEC peut être recommandée chez \\ndes patients ambulatoires stables correctement \\nsélectionnés et qui ont une insuffisance cardiaque due à une altération de la fonction systolique \\nventriculaire gauche. L’utilisation restreinte d’un \\ntraitement bêtabloquant après infarctus du myocarde, malgré la somme de preuves fournies \\npar les essais contrôlés randomisés en double \\naveugle, suggère que l’inquiétude à propos de son innocuité ainsi que la méconnaissance des \\npopulations cibles sont fréquentes. La poursuite de \\nl’accumulation d’informations  sur les bêtabloquants \\ndans l’insuffisance cardiaque est donc importante \\npuisque la population de patients insuffisants \\ncardiaques est beaucoup moins bien définie que celle des patients avec infarctus du myocarde. \\nLe traitement bêtabloquant de tous les patients en \\ninsuffisance cardiaque devrait être administré de façon progressive en commençant par de petites \\ndoses. La dose maximale et la vitesse à laquelle on \\ny parvient doivent être définies de façon plus \\nprécise. Il paraît justifié d’utiliser la dose maximale \\ntolérée mais, à présent, les recommandations sur la rapidité d’augmentation des doses ne peuvent être \\nfondées que sur les essais cliniques réalisés. \\nLes patients avec une insuffisance cardiaque sévère \\nde classe IV, ceux avec une insuffisance cardiaque \\naiguë au décours d’un in farctus du myocarde et \\nceux avec une dysfonction ventriculaire gauche asymptomatique sont l’objet d’études en cours avec \\nle carvédilol. \\nDans notre étude, la moyenne d’âge était de 61 ans \\nsoit une dizaine d’années de moins que chez les \\npatients vus en pratique clinique. De même, la \\nplupart des essais cliniques menés au cours de l’insuffisance cardiaque apportent une information \\ninadéquate sur les effets du traitement chez des \\npatients plus âgés et il y a un besoin fort de données supplémentaires chez ces patients. \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ', metadata={'source': './articles\\\\536f5c87da0ddda9754dea62a5ea86e9afc6f248.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='   7Bibliographie \\n \\n ', metadata={'source': './articles\\\\536f5c87da0ddda9754dea62a5ea86e9afc6f248.pdf', 'page': 6})]\n",

The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of death from any cause or unplanned hospitalization for heart failure at 12 months.\\nRESULTS\\nAt 12 months, the rate of the primary outcome was 54.6% (83 of 152 patients) in the intervention group and 51.3% (78 of 152 patients) in the control group (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 1.84; P = 0.53). The rate of death \\nfrom any cause was 24.3% (37 of 152 patients) in the intervention group and 22.4% (34 of 152 patients) in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.77). The rate of unplanned hospitalization for heart failure was 48.7% (74 of 152 pa\\n-\\ntients) in the intervention group and 47.4% (72 of 152 patients) in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.56).\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nAmong patients with severe secondary mitral regurgitation, the rate of death or unplanned hospitalization for heart failure at 1 year did not differ significantly between patients who underwent percutaneous mitral-valve repair in addition to receiving medical therapy and those who received medical therapy alone.

Severe secondary mitral regurgitation is a predictor of poor clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection frac -\\ntion.\\n1-4 However, whether mitral regurgitation in \\nthis patient population is merely the consequence of left ventricular dysfunction and dilation and a marker of severity or whether it contributes to a poor prognosis remains unclear.\\n2,4-7\\nProspective registry studies suggest that per -\\ncutaneous mitral-valve repair can reduce symp -\\ntoms and improve functional capacity and quality of life in patients with secondary mitral regurgi -\\ntation.\\n8-12 However, a beneficial effect on hard \\nclinical outcomes when percutaneous mitral-valve repair is added to medical treatment has not been proved. American and European guidelines are in agreement that there is a low level of evidence to support procedures (surgical or percutaneous) to correct mitral regurgitation in patients with sec -\\nondary mitral regurgitation, and they recommend that multicenter, randomized clinical trials be conducted in this patient population.\\n13-15 We de -\\nsigned the randomized MITRA-FR trial (Percuta -\\nneous Repair with the MitraClip Device for Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral Regurgitation) to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of percuta -\\nneous mitral-valve repair in addition to medical treatment in patients with heart failure and se -\\nvere secondary mitral regurgitation.\\nMethods\\nTrial Design and Oversight\\nMITRA-FR was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled phase 3 trial that was conducted in France. The trial was approved by a central ethics committee and the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety and was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki.\\nHospices Civils de Lyon, a public academic in -\\nstitution, assumed overall responsibility for the trial. A steering committee designed the trial pro -\\ntocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org), and an independent data and safety monitoring board oversaw the safety of the trial. The Clinical Investigation Center of Lyon, an academic research organization within Hospices Civils de Lyon (INSERM 1407), conducted and coordinated the trial and also collected the trial data. All the analyses were performed by the statistical department at Hospices Civils de Lyon. The first and last authors wrote the first draft of the manuscript. The steering committee reviewed the manuscript and made the decision to submit it for publication. The authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and the analyses and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\\nPrimary funding was provided by the French \\nMinistry of Health and Research National Pro -\\ngram. Abbott Vascular, the manufacturer of the trial device, provided the devices as well as support for investigators’ meetings; they also proctored the procedures for implantation of the device. De -\\ntails of the role of Abbott Vascular in the trial are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. Neither Abbott Vascular nor any other commercial entity had a role in the design of the trial; the selection of participating trial cen -\\nters; the monitoring or oversight of the centers; the enrollment or care of the patients; the collection, storage, analysis, or interpretation of the data; the writing of the manuscript; or the decision to sub -\\nmit the manuscript for publication.\\nPatients and Randomization\\nFrom December 2013 through March 2017, we re -\\ncruited patients at 37 trial centers in France. Cen -\\nters were required to have experience with percuta -\\nneous interventions and were to have performed at least five implantation procedures of the trial de -\\nvice before being selected as a trial site.\\nEligible patients had severe secondary mitral \\nregurgitation with a regurgitant volume of greater than 30 ml per beat or an effective regurgitant orifice area of greater than 20 mm\\n2 as assessed \\nby echocardiography, in accordance with the 2012 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and the European Association for Cardio-Thorac -\\nic Surgery.\\n14,16 Patients were also required to have \\na left ventricular ejection fraction between 15% and 40% and to have chronic heart failure symp -\\ntoms (assessed as New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class II, III, or IV).\\nPatients were excluded if they were consid -\\nered to be candidates for mitral-valve surgery, as determined by local multidisciplinary teams of \\nThe New England Journal of Medicine \\nDownloaded from nejm.org at BIBLIOTHEQUE UNIVERSITAIRE DU BOUGUEN on May 8, 2019.

Before randomization, all the patients underwent a prospective screening protocol that included one transthoracic echocardiogram and one transesophageal echocardiogram. All the echo -\\ncardiograms were reviewed at an independent central laboratory in accordance with European Association of Echocardiography guidelines.\\n17,18 \\nPatients were excluded if they did not meet core laboratory criteria (as described in the Supplemen -\\ntary Appendix, which also includes a complete list of the trial inclusion and exclusion criteria).\\nWritten informed consent was obtained from \\nall the patients before the initiation of trial pro -\\ncedures. Patients were then randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to either percutaneous mitral-valve repair plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone. Randomization was performed in permuted blocks, with stratification according to trial cen -\\nter. All eligible patients received medical treat -\\nment for chronic heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction according to the Eu -\\nropean guidelines that were current at the time of the trial.\\n13,19\\nPercutaneous-Repair Procedure\\nThe device used in this trial was the MitraClip (Abbott Vascular). This device received the Euro -\\npean Certificate of Conformity (known as the CE mark) in March 2008. The implantation procedure has been reported previously\\n7,18 and is described in \\nthe Supplementary Appendix. The procedure had to be performed within 21 days after a patient was randomly assigned to the intervention group. All implantation procedures were performed with proctoring from Abbott Vascular. Technical suc -\\ncess with respect to device implantation was de -\\nfined according to the consensus document from the Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium\\n20 \\n(additional details are provided in the Supplemen -\\ntary Appendix).\\nOutcomes\\nThe primary efficacy outcome was a composite of death from any cause or unplanned hospital -\\nization for heart failure at 12 months after ran -\\ndomization.\\n18 The prespecified secondary out -\\ncomes were individual components of the primary outcome at 12 months, death from cardiovascu -\\nlar causes, and survival free from major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or unplanned hospitaliza -\\ntion for heart failure). Prespecified serious adverse events included ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, the need for renal-replace -\\nment therapy, periprocedural complications, and bleeding events at 1 year after randomization. An independent events validation committee, whose members were unaware of the treatment assign -\\nments, adjudicated all the clinical outcomes.\\nAdditional prespecified secondary outcomes \\nincluded the change in left ventricular ejection fraction and in the end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters and volumes of the left ventricle; the severity of mitral regurgitation (semiquantitative grade of 0+ [none or trace], 1+ [mild], 2+ [mild to moderate], 3+ [moderate to severe], or 4+ [severe]; regurgitant volume; and effective regurgitant ori -\\nfice area); NYHA heart failure class; walking dis -\\ntance in the 6-minute walk test; brain natriuretic peptide levels; and quality-of-life scores on the European Quality of Life 5–Dimensions scale\\n21 at \\n12 months. Definitions of all the trial outcomes are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\\nStatistical Analysis\\nThe rate of death or unplanned hospitalization for heart failure at 12 months in patients with se -\\nvere secondary mitral regurgitation has been re -\\nported to be as high as 50%.\\n10 In addition, data \\nfrom the Pilot European Sentinel Registry involv -\\ning patients with severe secondary mitral regurgi -\\ntation who underwent percutaneous mitral-valve repair indicated that the rate of death or unplanned hospitalization for heart failure at 12 months was approximately 33%.\\n12 We calculated that 144 pa -\\ntients would need to be enrolled in each trial group to provide 80% power to show a rate of the primary outcome that was 17 percentage points lower in the intervention group than in the control group (50% vs. 33%), using a chi-square test at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and assuming a 10% rate of loss to follow-up.\\n18\\nAll the analyses were performed according to \\nthe intention-to-treat principle. For the primary efficacy analysis, an unconditional logistic-regres -\\nsion model was fitted to estimate the odds ratio associated with the treatment effect, with adjust -\\nment for the randomization stratification factor (trial center). The two-sided 95% Wald confidence interval of the treatment effect was computed. The between-group difference was tested with the use of the Wald chi-square test.

A per-protocol analysis of the primary outcome was also performed. This analysis excluded all patients who had a protocol deviation and all patients in the intervention group in whom the device was not implanted; the analysis also ex -\\ncluded all events that occurred during the first 21 days after randomization.\\nA two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was \\nconsidered to indicate statistical significance.  \\nP values for the secondary outcomes are not re -\\nported because no adjustment was made for multiplicity. Because a substantial amount of data on echocardiography, functional status, and qual -\\nity of life were missing at 12 months, the results for these variables are reported only descrip -\\ntively. All the statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute).\\nResults\\nPatients\\nA total of 452 patients provided written informed consent and underwent the screening protocol; 145 patients were excluded during the screening process ( Fig. 1, and Table S1 in the Supplemen -\\ntary Appendix). Thus, 307 patients with second -\\nary mitral regurgitation underwent randomiza -\\ntion: 152 patients were randomly assigned to undergo percutaneous mitral-valve repair in ad -\\ndition to receiving medical therapy (intervention group), and 155 to receive medical therapy alone (control group). Three patients were excluded from the control group after randomization ow -\\ning to issues with informed consent, which resulted in the inclusion of 152 patients in the control group. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups were similar at baseline, with the exception of a history of myo -\\ncardial infarction, which was more common in the intervention group ( Table 1). Medical therapy \\nat baseline was also similar in the two groups (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\\nProcedural Results\\nThe percutaneous mitral-valve repair procedure was performed a median of 14 days (interquar -tile range, 9 to 18) after randomization. Among the 152 patients in the intervention group, 14 (9.2%) had no study device implanted: implanta -\\ntion was not attempted in 8 patients, and the device implantation failed in 6 patients (details are provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Thus, implantation was attempted in 144 patients, and technical success with device implantation was achieved in 138 of these patients (95.8%). Among these 138 patients, 63 (45.7%) had one device implanted, 62 (44.9%) had two devices implanted, and 13 (9.4%) had three or more de -\\nvices implanted. A total of 21 of the 144 patients (14.6%) in whom implantation was attempted had periprocedural complications ( Table 2).\\nAt the time of discharge from the hospital, \\nassessments of the severity of mitral regurgita -\\ntion were available for 123 patients in the inter -\\nvention group. Of these patients, 117 (95.1%) had a reduction in mitral regurgitation of at least one grade; 113 patients (91.9%) had reduction of mitral regurgitation to 2+ (mild to moderate) or lower, and 93 patients (75.6%) had reduction to 0+ (none or trace) to 1+ (mild) (Fig. S1 in the Supplemen -\\ntary Appendix).\\nEfficacy Outcomes and Adverse Events\\nIn the intention-to-treat analysis, the composite primary outcome of death from any cause or unplanned hospitalization for heart failure at 12 months occurred in 83 patients (54.6%) in the intervention group and in 78 patients (51.3%) in the control group (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confi -\\ndence interval [CI], 0.73 to 1.84; P = 0.53) (Table  3 \\nand Fig. 2). At 12 months, a total of 37 deaths \\n(24.3%) had occurred in the intervention group and 34 (22.4%) in the control group (hazard ra -\\ntio in the intervention group, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.77). A total of 74 patients (48.7%) in the intervention group had an unplanned hospital -\\nization for heart failure, as compared with 72 patients (47.4%) in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.56) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). All the other major cardiovascular events that occurred are summa -\\nrized in Table 3. The results of the per-protocol analysis were consistent with those of the inten -\\ntion-to-treat analysis (Table S4 in the Supplemen -\\ntary Appendix). The mortality rate at 30 days was 3.3% (5 patients) in the intervention group and 2.6% (4 patients) in the control group.\\nThe incidence of prespecified serious adverse \\nevents is presented in Table 2.

Enrollment, Randomization, and Follow-up.\\nAdditional details regarding the reasons for patient exclusion from the trial before randomization are provided in Ta -\\nble S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.

There were no signifi -\\ncant interactions between trial group and any of the subgroups with respect to the rate of a primary outcome event at 12 months, with the exception of a possible interaction of treatment assignment with serum creatinine level at baseline.\\nDiscussion\\nThe MITRA-FR trial showed that in patients with severe secondary mitral regurgitation, percutaneous mitral-valve repair plus medical treatment did not result in a lower rate of the composite outcome of death from any cause or unplanned hospitaliza -\\ntion for heart failure at 12 months than medical treatment alone. This result was consistent across all the subgroups tested, with one possible excep -\\ntion; although a significant interaction with the subgroup defined according to baseline serum creatinine was detected, we believe that this is probably a chance finding.\\nThe MitraClip device evaluated in this trial is \\nincreasingly used in many countries, mainly for secondary mitral regurgitation.\\n9,10,12,22 Previous re -\\nports have shown a benefit with percutaneous mitral-valve repair for correction of mitral regur -\\ngitation and improvement in functional status and have suggested significant improvements in hard clinical outcomes at 12 months.\\n10,23 Howev -\\ner, these studies were not randomized, controlled trials.

Unfortunately, substantial amounts of echocar-diographic data were missing at 12 months, so we cannot confirm a durable result of percutane-ous repair with respect to the reduction of mitral regurgitation at 1 year for many of the trial par-ticipants.\\nThe lack of a clinical benefit of percutaneous \\nmitral-valve repair on the primary outcome sug-gests that the underlying cardiomyopathy might be the principal driver of subsequent adverse clinical outcomes in patients with secondary mitral regur-gitation. In this context, secondary mitral regurgi-tation may be merely a marker of illness severity and not a direct contributor to the pathophysiol-ogy of heart failure.\\nAnother explanation for the lack of clinical \\nbenefit that we observed could be the fact that some of the patients who underwent percutane-ous mitral-valve repair had incomplete correc-tion of mitral regurgitation. Although echocar-diographic data were missing for many of the patients, at least 48 patients in the intervention group had residual mitral regurgitation of grade 2+ or higher at 12 months.

The potential benefit of percutaneous mitral-valve repair might be diminished in patients with more serious illness. However, in the prespecified subgroup analyses, the variables of age older than 75 years, NYHA class III or IV heart failure, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30% did not show any significant interaction with treatment.\\nThe lack of benefit could also be explained by \\nthe good quality of the medical treatment in the control group; the baseline use of heart-failure drugs in the control group was very high, in concordance with the guidelines.\\n13,19 These heart \\nfailure drugs included the new class of angioten -\\nsin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor drugs that be -\\ncame available in France during the course of the trial.\\n25 We do not have systematic information \\nabout the rates of the use of individual classes of drugs during the course of the trial.\\nOur trial has several limitations. First, in 14 \\npatients (9.2%) in the intervention group, either the procedure was not performed or the device implantation failed. However, in the per-protocol analysis in which the data from these patients were excluded, no significant difference in outcomes was seen between the two groups at 12 months. Second, the considerable amount of missing fol -\\nlow-up data for the assessments of echocardiog -\\nraphy, functional status, natriuretic peptide, and quality of life is a limitation of the trial. However, a very low number of patients was lost to follow-up for the primary outcome, with 99% of the patients having complete data at 12 months. Third, the trial was powered to detect a substantial effect on the primary outcome (an event rate of 50% in the control group vs. 33% in the intervention group). Therefore, we did not have power to detect a smaller difference between the groups, although the point estimate for the primary outcome does not suggest a trend in favor of percutaneous mitral-valve repair.\\nIn conclusion, in this multicenter, random -\\nized, open-label, controlled trial involving pa -\\ntients with severe secondary mitral regurgita -\\ntion, the rate of the composite primary outcome of death or unplanned hospitalization for heart failure at 12 months did not differ significant -\\nly between the intervention group and the con -\\ntrol group.\\nSupported by the French Ministry of Health and Research \\nNational Program and Abbott Vascular.\\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with \\nthe full text of this article at NEJM.org.\\nA data sharing statement provided by the authors is available \\nwith the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\\nWe thank personnel from Hospices Civils de Lyon, including \\nMuriel Malbezin, Valerie Plattner, Justine Bricout, and the clini -\\ncal research associates, for their work on this trial; Florent Prion and Isabelle Codogno for their support at the central laboratory that provided echocardiographic assessment; and personnel from Abbott Vascular for their transparency and their attention to quality in proctoring the implantation procedures.\\nThis article is dedicated to the memory of Larry Gotlieb for \\nhis help in the early phase of the trial.\\nAppendix\\nThe authors’ full names and academic degrees are as follows: Jean-François Obadia, M.D., Ph.D., David Messika-Zeitoun, M.D., Ph.D., Guillaume Leurent, M.D., Bernard Iung, M.D., Guillaume Bonnet, M.D., Nicolas Piriou, M.D., Thierry Lefèvre, M.D., Christophe Piot, M.D., Ph.D., Frédéric Rouleau, M.D., Didier Carrié, M.D., Ph.D., Mohammed Nejjari, M.D., Patrick Ohlmann, M.D., Florence Leclercq, M.D., Ph.D., Christophe Saint Etienne, M.D., Emmanuel Teiger, M.D., Lionel Leroux, M.D., Nicole Karam, M.D., Nicolas Michel, M.D., Martine Gilard, M.D., Ph.D., Erwan Donal, M.D., Ph.D., Jean-Noël Trochu, M.D., Ph.D., Bertrand Cormier, M.D., Xavier Armoiry, Pharm.D., Ph.D., Florent Boutitie, Ph.D., Delphine Maucort-Boulch, M.D., Ph.D., Cécile Barnel, M.Sc., Géraldine Samson, Pharm.D., Patrice Guerin, M.D., Ph.D., Alec Vahanian, M.D., and Nathan Mewton, M.D., Ph.D.\\nThe authors’ affiliations are as follows: Hopital Cardiovasculaire Louis Pradel, Chirurgie Cardio-Vasculaire et Transplantation Cardi\\n-\\naque (J.-F.O.), Pharmacy Department and Laboratoire Mateis (X.A.), and Hopital Cardiovasculaire Louis Pradel, Clinical Investigation Center and Heart Failure Department, INSERM 1407 (C.B., G.S., N.

Sodium bicarbonate infusion for the \\ntreatment of severe metabolic acidaemia is a possible treatment option but remains controversial, as no studies to \\ndate have examined its effect on clinical outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether sodium bicarbonate infusion would improve these outcomes in critically ill patients.\\nMethods We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial. Local investigators screened eligible \\npatients from 26 intensive care units (ICUs) in France. We included adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who were admitted \\nwithin 48 h to the ICU with severe acidaemia (pH ≤7⋅20, PaCO\\n2 ≤45 mm Hg, and sodium bicarbonate concentration \\n≤20 mmol/L) and with a total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 4 or more or an arterial lactate concentration of 2 mmol/L or more. We randomly assigned patients (1:1), by stratified randomisation with minimisation via a restricted web platform, to receive either no sodium bicarbonate (control group) or 4⋅2% of intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion (bicarbonate group) to maintain the arterial pH above 7⋅30. Our protocol recommended that the volume of each infusion should be within the range of 125–250 mL in 30 min, with a maximum of 1000 mL within 24 h after inclusion. Randomisation criteria were stratified among three prespecified strata: age, sepsis status, and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) score. The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause by day 28 and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7. All analyses were done on data from the intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who underwent randomisation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02476253.\\nFindings Between May 5, 2015, and May 7, 2017, we enrolled 389 patients into the intention-to-treat analysis in the \\noverall population (194 in the control group and 195 in the bicarbonate group). The primary outcome occurred in \\n138 (71%) of 194 patients in the control group and 128 (66%) of 195 in the bicarbonate group (absolute difference estimate –5⋅5%, 95% CI –15⋅2 to 4⋅2; p=0⋅24). The Kaplan-Meier method estimate of the probability of survival at day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was not significant (46% [95% CI 40–54] vs 55% [49–63]; \\np=0⋅09. In the prespecified AKIN stratum of patients with a score of 2 or 3, the Kaplan-Meier method estimate of survival by day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was significant (63% [95% CI 52–72] vs 46% [35–55]; p=0⋅0283). Metabolic alkalosis, hypernatraemia, and hypocalcaemia were observed more frequently in the bicarbonate group than in the control group, with no life-threatening complications reported.\\nInterpretation In patients with severe metabolic acidaemia, sodium bicarbonate had no effect on the primary \\ncomposite outcome. However, sodium bicarbonate decreased the primary composite outcome and day 28 mortality in \\nthe a-priori defined stratum of patients with acute kidney injury.\\nFunding French Ministry of Health and the Société Française d’Anesthésie Réanimation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The reluctance to use sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of severe metabolic acidaemia might be \\nrelated to the absence of cardiovascular effects in two physiological studies\\n10,11 and potential side \\xadeffects, \\nprincipally intra  cellular acidification due to the \\naccumulation of carbon dioxide and the risk of hypocalcaemia.\\n3,10,14 However, sodium bicarbonate could \\ncompensate for the deleterious effects of acidotic cells on cardiovascular and oxygen delivery, and might delay or avoid unnecessary early renal\\n\\xadreplacement therapy.\\nThe 2016 \\nupdate of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign \\nInternational Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock\\n15 suggested that the effect of sodium \\nbicarbonate administration on haemodynamics and vasopressor requirements at lower pH as well as its effect on clinical outcomes at any pH level is unknown, and no studies have examined the effect of sodium bicarbonate administration on clinical outcomes. The absence of high\\n\\xadlevel evidence leaves \\nICU clinicians uncertain \\nwhether sodium bicarbonate infusion is beneficial, ineffective, or indeed harmful to patients with severe metabolic acidaemia. Given such uncertainties, we aimed to evaluate whether sodium bicarbonate infusion \\nwould improve clinical outcome in critically ill patients with severe metabolic acidaemia. Specifically, we hypothesised that early sodium bicarbonate infusion compared with no infusion would result in fewer deaths from any cause by 28 days and lower incidence of at least one organ failure at 7 days in adult ICU patients with severe metabolic acidaemia.\\nMethods\\nStudy design and patients\\nWe did a multicentre, open \\xadlabel, randomised controlled, \\nphase 3 trial. Local investigators screened eligible patients from 26 ICUs \\nin France. The study protocol and \\nstatistical analysis plan was approved for all centres by a central ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud\\n\\xadEst IV, Montpellier\\n, France; EudraCT, \\nnumber 2014 \\xad000245 \\xad73) in accordance \\nwith both French \\nlaw and the Declaration of Helsinki.\\nWe included adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who were \\nadmitted within 48 h to the ICU with severe acidaemia (pH ≤7⋅20, PaCO\\n2 ≤45 mm Hg, and sodium bicarbonate \\nconcentration ≤20 mmol/L)5 and with a total Sequential \\nOrgan Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 4 or more or an arterial lactate concentration of 2 mmol/L or more. Research in context\\nEvidence before this study\\nWe searched PubMed from Jan 1, 1990, to Feb 1, 2018, using the search terms “sodium bicarbonate” or “metabolic acidemia”. Studies were included if they evaluated sodium bicarbonate infusion as an intervention to treat severe metabolic acidaemia. Our review indicates that sodium bicarbonate infusion to increase the arterial pH in this condition has been sparsely evaluated. Animal studies, single centre crossover studies with physiological parameters as a main outcome, and reviews from experts have recommended against its use. Surveys and observational studies have, however, reported that more than half of the critical care physicians or nephrologists would consider sodium bicarbonate infusion for a patient with severe metabolic acidaemia whatever its cause. Finally, the 2017 Surviving Sepsis Campaign stated that “the effect of sodium bicarbonate administration on hemodynamics and vasopressor requirements at lower pH (than 7–15 as well as the effect on clinical outcomes at any pH level, is unknown” and that “no studies have examined the effect of bicarbonate administration on outcomes”.\\nAdded value of this study\\nThis is the first large randomised clinical trial comparing two groups of no sodium bicarbonate infusion (control group) with sodium bicarbonate infusion (bicarbonate group) in 400 critically ill patients with severe metabolic acidaemia (pH ≤7·20) from 26 Intensive Care Units. In this trial, we report that in the overall population sodium bicarbonate infusion was not associated with an improvement in the primary outcome (ie, composite criteria of organ failure at day 7 and any cause of death at day 28). In the a-priori defined clinical stratum of patients with acute kidney injury (with Acute Kidney Injury Network scores of 2 or 3 at enrolment), the primary outcome occurred less frequently in the bicarbonate group than in the control group. Additionally, the number of days alive and free from renal-replacement therapy was higher in the bicarbonate group than in the control group both in the overall study population and in the a-priori defined stratum of patients with acute kidney injury. No other organ support parameters were different among treatment groups.\\nImplications of all the available evidence\\nThe findings of the BICAR-ICU trial suggest that sodium bicarbonate infusion is associated with an improved outcome and a reduced rate of mortality from enrolment to day 28 in critically ill patients with severe metabolic acidaemia (pH ≤7·20) and acute kidney injury. Sodium bicarbonate infusion was also associated with more days alive and free from renal-replacement therapy. However, in the overall non-selected patients, sodium bicarbonate infusion was not associated with a clinical outcome. \\nFurther studies should be done to investigate whether sodium bicarbonate infusion might improve survival in a larger dataset and in selected patients with severe metabolic acidaemia and acute kidney injury.', metadata={'source': './articles\\\\984b38778ea9ead6e737e2f6da347d67cbd5a2d7.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Articleswww.thelancet.com   Published online June 14, 2018   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31080-8  3We excluded patients who met the following main \\nexclusion criteria: respiratory acidosis, proven digestive or urinary tract loss of sodium bicar\\n bonate (volume loss  \\n≥1500 mL per day), stage IV chronic kidney disease,16 \\nketoacidosis, and sodium bicarbonate infusion (including renal\\n\\xadreplacement therapy) within 24 h before screening. \\nThe appendix provides the full exclusion criteria.\\nWe obtained written informed consent from the patient \\nor a relative upon study inclusion. However\\n, considering \\nthe severity of the illness, the fact that most of these patients would be unable to consent (sedation or potential delirium)\\n17–19 and that their proxies might not be \\ncontactable at the time of inclusion, a deferred consent process for emergency situations was enabled. When deferred consent was used, written permission to pursue the research was obtained from the patient or proxy as soon as possible. If this consent was not obtained, the patient’s data were not used and they were withdrawn from the trial.\\nRandomisation and masking\\nWe randomly assigned eligible patients within 48 h of ICU admission in a one\\n\\xadto\\xadone ratio to receive either no sodium \\nbicarbonate infusion (control group) or sodium bi\\xad\\ncarbonate infusion \\n(bicarbonate group). We randomly \\nassigned patients by stratified randomisation with mini\\xadmisation using a computer\\n\\xadgenerated allocation sequence \\naccessible from \\neach centre through a secured \\xaddedicated \\nwebsite with stratifi  cation according to study site and \\nthree prespecified factors: age with a cutoff of 65 years, presence or absence of suspected sepsis,\\n20,21 and presence \\nor absence of Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) score of 2 or 3. Because sodium bicarbonate infusion influences arterial pH levels and because routine arterial blood gases must be done in critically ill patients, masking of the physicians and nurses was not feasible.\\nProcedures\\nIn the intervention group, 4⋅2% sodium bicarbonate was intravenously infused with the aim of achieving an \\narterial pH of 7⋅30 or more during the 28\\n\\xadday ICU \\nadmission or ICU discharge because preliminary results suggested that arterial \\npH in survivors approximated \\n7⋅30 by day 1 although persistent severe acidaemia was observed in non\\n\\xadsurvivors.5 Our protocol recommended \\nthat the volume of each sodium bicarbonate infusion \\nshould be within the range of 125–250 mL in 30 min, with a maximum of 1000 mL within 24 h after inclusion, and that measurement of arterial blood gas should be done 1–4 h after the end of each infusion (appendix p 17).

Assuming less than 8% non\\n\\xadanalysable patients (loss to follow \\xadup or \\nconsent withdrawal), we planned to randomly assign 400 patients.\\nAll analyses were done on data from the intention\\n\\xad\\nto\\xadtreat population, which \\nincluded all patients who \\nunderwent randomisation. In the per \\xadprotocol analysis, we \\nexcluded patients with protocol violations (appendix). W\\ne made no imputation for missing values. Baseline \\ncharacteristics in each study group were analysed as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and as means and SDs or medians and IQRs for continuous variables, as appropriate. We used an unadjusted χ² test for the primary outcome analysis and its two components (ie, death from any cause by 28 days and the presence of at least one organ failure at 7 days). We did a multiple logistic regression for the primary outcome. The survival time was described by means of Kaplan\\n\\xadMeier method and \\ncompared with a log \\xadrank test. A Cox proportional \\xadhazards \\nmodel was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for death. F\\nor this analysis, data from all patients were censored at \\nthe time of death or at day 28. Logistic and Cox regression models were adjusted on relevant baseline covariates. Covariates were defined as binary variables and continuous variables dichotomised according to their median tested in the model, and were selected in a backward selection procedure if p<0⋅15 in the univariate analysis and then presented as adjusted odds ratios (ORs) or HRs with 95% CIs (appendix pp 28–34).

The corresponding author had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\\nResults\\nFrom May 5, 2015, to May 7, 2017, a total of 942 patients \\nwith severe metabolic acidaemia were assessed for trial eligibility (figure 1). Of these patients, 542 were excluded and 400 were randomly assigned to the study groups (201 in the control group and 199 in the bicarbonate group). After secondary exclusion of 11 patients who withdrew consent, a total of 389 patients were included in the intention\\n\\xadto\\xadtreat analysis (n=194 in the control group and\\n \\nn=195 in the bicarbonate group). The characteristics of the patients were well balanced between the two groups (table 1; appendix pp 28, 29). At randomisation, sepsis was present in 238 (61%) of 389 patients and acute kidney injury with AKIN scores of 2 or 3 in 182 (47%) patients. Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 324 (83%) of 389 patients and vasopressors in 310 (80%) patients. Data for the primary outcome were available for all patients.\\nOverall, 341 (88%) of 389 patients adhered to the planned \\ntreatment in their randomisation group. Sodium bicarb\\xadonate was infused in 47 (24%) of 194 patients in the control group, starting at a median of 7 h (IQR 3–27) after randomisation, and in 194 (99%) of 195 patients in the bicarbonate group, starting at a median of 0·2 h (0⋅1–0⋅4) after randomisation (table 2; appendix p 17). The proportion of patients in whom the targeted pH of 7⋅30 was reached and maintained for at least 36 h from enrolment to day 2 was 50 (26%) of 194 patients in the control group and 117 (60%) of 195 patients in the bicarbonate group, taking into account patients who died in the first 48 h (p<0⋅0001; appendix pp 18, 19). Overall, fluid intake from enrolment to day 1 and from day 1 to day 2 was not different between the two groups (table 2; appendix p 30).\\nFollow\\n\\xadup data were available for all patients for the \\nprimary composite outcome (ie, death by day 28 or at least one \\norgan failure at day 7).

In our \\ntrial, early sodium bicarbonate infusion might have bought time in patients with unstable severe metabolic acidaemia and either avoided or delayed the initiation of the therapy in some patients. Vasopressor\\n\\xadfree days were shorter in \\nthe control group than in the bicarbonate group of the AKIN \\n2–3 stratum. Sodium bicarbonate might also have \\ncounterbalanced the deleterious consequences of severe acidosis on myocardial contract\\n ility, systemic vaso\\xad\\ndilatation, tissue perfusion, or cellular function3,14 that \\nmight be associated with vaso  pressor dependency. \\nAlthough it could be speculated that delayed or absence of renal\\n\\xadreplacement therapy in the control group was \\nassociated with more cardiovascular insta  bility, recent \\ntrials comparing early versus late renal \\xadreplacement \\ntherapy in critically ill patients do not support this hypothesis.\\n29,30 Sodium bicarbonate infusion was associated \\nwith metabolic side \\xadeffects such as hypernatraemia, \\nhypocalcaemia, and metabolic alkalosis, but none of these episodes were reported as life\\n\\xadthreatening in our trial.\\nThere are, however, limitations in our study. N\\no specific \\ncontrol solution was recommended in the control group because there is no fluid without an effect on the acid–base balance. The fluid therapy from enrolment to day 2 was, however, similar in the two groups. Additionally, the physicians caring for the patients in the ICU could not be masked because regular monitoring of arterial blood gases is part of the routine care in patients with severe metabolic acidaemia with a very high risk of mortality. Furthermore, sodium bicarbonate infusion was titrated to reach and maintain a targeted pH of 7⋅30. However, the endpoints of mortality by day 28 or the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7 were collected and assessed by study members masked to treatment assignment. Another limitation is that the protocol suggested a range of 4⋅2% sodium bicarbonate volume (125–250 mL per infusion) in the bicarbonate group rather than using a formula to calculate the base deficit and provide a tailored sodium bicarbonate infusion; therefore, we cannot extrapolate whether different ways of administration would have resulted in other outcomes. We also chose not to stratify patients according to the acidaemia mechanism, because the trial was designed to be a pragmatic study. Additionally, the mechanical ventilation settings were not collected. Finally, the causes of acidaemia were heterogeneous, even if septic and haemorrhagic shock were the most common reasons. However, we carefully avoided inclusion of patients with gastrointestinal loss of base or patients with tubular acidosis for whom the indication of sodium bicarbonate infusion is not controversial.\\nDespite these limitations, our trial presents several \\nstrengths, including the multicentre study design, the pragmatism of its design, the well balanced demographic characteristics, and the intention\\n\\xadto\\xadtreat \\nanalysis, suggesting that its main result might be generalisable to critically ill patients presenting with severe metabolic acidaemia and at least one organ failure.\\nIn conclusion, in patients with severe metabolic \\nacidaemia, sodium bicarbonate treatment had no effect on the primary composite outcome (ie, mortality by day 28 or the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7), but decreased the need for renal\\n\\xadreplacement \\ntherapy. Additionally\\n, sodium bicarbonate treatment did \\ndecrease mortality in the a \\xadpriori defined stratum of \\npatients with acute kidney injury. Whether a different protocol of sodium bicarbonate infusion in terms of tonicity or \\nspeed of acidaemia correction could influence \\nthe outcome remains to be determined and should be evaluated in future trials.\\nContributors\\nSJ, NM, and BJ designed the study and wrote the report.
