Thus, assess-\\ning the impact of hearing loss with and without management on health outcomes is a matter of major importance to elderly individu-als and the field of public health. Healthy aging embraces cognitive, physical, and emotional dimensions. Indeed, most definitions con-sider that preserved cognitive functioning, functional autonomy in daily life activities, and emotional well-being are the main features of successful aging (18). In that perspective, in addition to death, dementia, depression, and disability can be viewed as the cardinal markers of successful or pathological aging. Such conditions not only have devastating effects at individuals’ level, but they also are the main sources of burden for family caregivers and—at least three of them—generate heavy costs for our societies.\\nThe present study was conducted within the PAQUID survey, a \\nprospective population-based study involving 25\\xa0years of follow-up, and consisted in assessing the relationship between hearing status and the occurrence of four major adverse events: death, dementia, depression, and disability.\\nMethods\\nStudy Population and Protocol\\nThe PAQUID study is a French epidemiological study relying on a population-based sample of 3,777 community-dwelling individu-als aged 65 or older. The study has received the approval of Ethics Committee of the Bordeaux University Hospital, and all participants gave their written informed consent to participate in this study. Volunteers were evaluated at home at the initial visit (T0) and at 1 (T1), 3 (T3), 5 (T5), 8 (T8), 10 (T10), 13 (T13), 15 (T15), 17 (T17), 20 (T20), 22 (T22), and 25 (T25) years. Each visit included a neuro-psychological evaluation and a criteria checklist for dementia diag-nosis completed by a trained psychologist. At each follow-up visit, tests and scales of cognitive performances, cognitive complaints, functional abilities, and depressive symptomatology were adminis-tered to participants. A\\xa0short neuropsychological battery has been administered comprising Mini-Mental State Examination (19) pro-viding a global assessment of cognitive functioning. Full details of the study have been described elsewhere (20). Table\\xa01 displays the \\nstudy participation all along the 25\\xa0years of follow-up.Hearing Status Measures\\nAt baseline, a short questionnaire assessing self-perceived hearing problems has been administered. To the question “do you have hear -\\ning trouble?” the participant could respond as follows: (a) I\\xa0do not have hearing trouble; (b) I\\xa0have trouble following the conversation with two or more people talking at the same time or in a noisy back-ground; and (c) I\\xa0have major hearing trouble. Participants were also asked whether they used a hearing aid or not.\\nDeath\\nAt each follow-up, vital status was systematically recorded for all the participants. Data on vital status and date of death were collected from family, physicians, and civil state records.\\nDepressive Symptoms\\nDepressive symptomatology was assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (21). Participants were considered as having depressive symptomatology when the score was equal to 23 or higher for women and 17 or higher for men.\\nDisability\\nTwo domains of disability based on the concepts of basic activi-ties of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) were used as outcomes. Based on the Lawton–Brody scale (22), disability in IADL was assessed according to the ability of the participants to use a telephone, manage medication, manage money, use public or private transport, and do shopping, for both genders, and add-itionally, to do the laundry, do housework, and prepare meals for\\xa0women.\\nDisability in ADL was assessed using five items of the Katz scale \\n(23): bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring from bed to chair, and eating. Incontinence, which is an impairment rather than a disability (24), was not considered\\xa0here.\\nA participant was considered as disabled if he or she could not \\nperform at least one activity of the domain without a given level of assistance, as defined in the respective instruments (22, 23).\\nDementia Diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of dementia relied on a three-step procedure. After the interview and neuropsychological evaluation, the psychologist com-pleted a criteria checklist for dementia diagnosis. Individuals who met dementia criteria were seen by a neurologist or geriatrician who confirmed or rejected the diagnosis according to current standards. At final step, the diagnosis of dementia and its etiology was reviewed by an independent panel of specialized neurologists.\\nStudy\\xa0Sample\\nAll 3,777 participants of the PAQUID cohort were eligible for this analysis, with the exception of those with a diagnosis of dementia at baseline visit (n\\xa0=\\xa0102) and those who did not complete the ques-tionnaire on hearing problems (n\\xa0=\\xa093). Of these, 3,588 had avail-able data for the analyses on mortality and those on dementia. In addition, to study the occurrence of each outcome studied (disability in ADL, disability in ADL, and depression), we excluded the par -\\nticipants already having the condition at baseline. So, samples were as follows: 3,452 for the analyses on disability in ADL, 2,561 for the analyses on disability in IADL, and 3,119 for the analyses on depression.

In a first model, the predictor variable was hearing loss: self-reported hearing loss and no self-reported hearing loss. In additional exploratory analyses, the group of participants reporting hearing loss was stratified according to hearing-aid\\xa0use.\\nAnalyses of the risk of occurrence of the outcome variables \\nwere performed using a Cox proportional hazards model (25). The number of years since the baseline was used as the basic time scale in the analysis. For each outcome, multivariate analyses controlled for age, gender, educational level (defined in two categories: no formal education and school certificate or higher), and the number of comorbidities (including hypertension, myocardial infarction, angor, diabetes, dyspnea, history of stroke, and smoking) were performed. Interactions with gender were tested to assess whether gender modu-lated the relationship between hearing status and each of the to-be-predicted outcomes. Analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.3), Proc Phreg (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).\\nResults\\nParticipants\\nMean age of the whole sample at baseline was 75.3 (SD\\xa0=\\xa06.8), 57.8 per cent were women. Table\\xa02 displays the baseline characteristics of \\nthe three subgroups of participants. At baseline, 2,299 reported no hearing trouble, 1,113 reported hearing problems not using hearing aids (of whom 49.7% were women), and 176 reported hearing prob-lems using hearing aids (of whom 44.9% were women). Significant differences between the three groups of participants were observed for all variables.\\nSelf-reported Hearing Loss and Risk of Death, \\nDepression, Disability, and Dementia\\nTable\\xa03 displays the hazard ratios (HR) estimated by multivariate \\nCox models for death, depression, disability, and dementia for the group of participants with self-reported hearing problems compared with participants reporting no hearing problems. As may be seen, after adjustment for sociodemographic and health variables, an increased risk of dementia and of disability in ADL were found in elders with self-reported hearing problems. There was a statistical trend for disability in IADL. For mortality, dementia, and disability, there was no significant interaction with gender. However, a signifi-cant interaction with gender was found for depression (p\\xa0=\\xa0.03).\\nStratified Analysis According to Hearing-Aid\\xa0Use\\nTable\\xa0 4 reports the results of additional exploratory models con-ducted after stratifying the group of participants reporting hearing loss according to hearing-aid use. No increased risk of mortality was found in elders with self-reported hearing problems whether they used hearing aids or not. Regarding depression, no increased risk was found for the group of participants reporting hearing problems (using or not using hearing aids) compared with the participants reporting no hearing problems. Due to significant interaction with gender, stratified analyses were conducted and showed that self-reported hearing problems with no hearing aids were associated with higher risk of depression in men (Table\\xa05). Regarding disability, the model showed an increased risk of disability in ADL for the group of participants with self-reported hearing problems not using hear -\\ning aids. No increased risk was found for those with self-reported hearing problems using hearing aids compared with the participants reporting no hearing problems. Actually in this group, the HR was <1 (HR\\xa0=\\xa00.81). Similarly, for disability in IADL, the model showed an increased risk for the participants with self-reported hearing problems not using hearing aids but not for those using hearing aids. Finally, regarding dementia, the model showed an increased risk for the group of participants with self-reported hearing problems not using hearing aids. No increased risk was found for those with self-reported hearing problems using hearing aids compared with the group reporting no hearing problems. Actually in this group, the HR was <1 (HR\\xa0=\\xa00.86).\\nDiscussion\\nWith a design involving 25\\xa0years of follow-up of a population-based cohort of elderly participants, our study evidenced a significant asso-ciation between self-reported hearing problems and increased risk of ADL and IADL disability and dementia. It was also associated with increased risk of depression in men. Regarding mortality, similar risk of death all along the 25\\xa0years of study follow-up was found in par -\\nticipants with or without self-reported hearing problems.\\nNumerous studies had reported a negative association between \\nhearing impairment and depression and social isolation (2, 3). \\nInterestingly in our study, such a negative impact was particularly seen in men. This result could be linked to gender differences in audiometric shapes of presbyacusic individuals. Men seem to show more loss than women at frequencies above 1\\xa0kHz, whereas women show more loss below 1\\xa0 kHz probably because different factors may be involved in age-related hearing loss phenomenon in males and females (eg noise exposure and microvascular disease) (26). With high frequency loss affecting speech comprehension, the po-tential impact in daily life may be different and repercussions on communication abilities more important in men. Some studies also reported an association with disability. However, they were either cross-sectional (27, 28) or involved a very short follow-up period \\n(29). In addition to the long follow-up, our study has the advantage to measure disability in both ADL and IADL and yielded consistent results for the two domains of disability. Regarding dementia, few studies have reported an increased risk of developing dementia in \\nFigure\\xa01.  Flow of participants through study, PAQUID cohort.Journals of Gerontology: MEDICAL SCIENCES, 2018, Vol. 00, No. 00 3\\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/gerona/glx250/4783130\\nby INSERM user\\non 12 February 2018', metadata={'source': './articles/0dacb0b566cb38438b84aa092176c6d42bf4402d.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='older adults with hearing impairment (9, 30, 31). Therefore, along \\nwith prior findings, our results strongly reinforce the assumption \\nthat self-reported hearing problems in elders contribute to develop depression, disability, and dementia. Regarding mortality, the litera-ture is mitigated. Some studies showed higher mortality (32), others reported no association (33), whereas others suggested an associ-ation with mortality mediated by factors such as cognitive impair -\\nment, disability, or subjective health (34). In our study, similar risk of mortality all along the 25\\xa0years of study follow-up was found in participants with or without self-reported hearing problems.\\nInterestingly, negative associations between self-reported hear -\\ning trouble and depression, disability, and dementia were not evi-denced in older adults using hearing aids. In other words, elders with self-reported hearing problems using hearing aids presented similar risk of developing depression, disability, and dementia all along the 25\\xa0years of follow-up of the study as their counterparts reporting no hearing impairment. Such a result had never been reported.Some longitudinal data have looked at the impact of hearing-aid \\nuse on health outcomes. These studies have reported positive im-pact on quality of life (11), handicap and better physical health (12), and cognitive decline (13). Scarce RCTs have looked at the impact of hearing-aid use on health. Three of them reported reductions in hearing handicap in the hearing-aid group (14–16) and one found no impact (17). As may be seen, limited information is available from longitudinal observational studies or RCTs regarding the effect of hearing aids on disability and mental health. Most of the studies to date have been limited to short-term outcomes associated with hear -\\ning-aid use. Yet, one would expect that the positive impact of hear -\\ning-aid use may only emerge after a longer time frame. Cognitive decline, disability, and dementia are slowly progressive phenomena that can only be captured over a time scale of several years. Some protective effects of hearing-aid use may therefore only be observ-able over a time scale of years or decades and may be missed by RCTs or short prospective observational studies.T able\\xa02.

Another strength is the population-based design, and the interviews that were con-ducted in participants’ homes, facilitating the participation of frailer older people. However, to be included in the study, participants were required to be able to communicate during the home interview. This criterion probably decreased the number of persons with severe hearing impairment. Moreover, multiple factors may affect whether an individual with hearing loss uses or not hearing aids such as income, health awareness, or personality traits. Even though numer -\\nous potentially confounding variables have been controlled for in our study, obviously we cannot exclude residual effects of uncon-trolled variables. In particular, the question of what differs in people who use hearing aids compared with those who do not is a critical but complex issue. Further studies should try to better character -\\nize what makes people with hearing loss seek for care and whether such characteristics can explain at least partially the potential ben-efits of hearing-aid use. As recommended by previous studies having validated the CESD-scale in French elderly population (35), we used different cut-points for men and women. This could have potential implications on the interpretation of results related to depression outcome. Another limitation of our study relies on the self-reported measure of hearing impairment. Hearing status and hearing-aid use could have changed all along the follow-up period. In addition, no audiometric measure is available. Our measure simply consisted in collecting self-perceived hearing difficulty which is far less precise than an audiometric measure. Nonetheless, numerous studies have shown that self-reported hearing loss is highly correlated to audio-metric measures of hearing loss in older adults (36–41). In addition, from a practical point of view, in a perspective of screening for hear -\\ning loss in elderly persons and its potential consequences, such an easy-to-collect measure may be useful.\\nOur study shows that self-reported hearing trouble is associated \\nwith increased risk of disability, dementia, and also depression in men. Such increased risks were not evidenced in those older adults using hearing aids. Because hearing impairment in older adults is T able\\xa04.

Healthy aging embraces cognitive, physical, and emotional dimensions. Indeed, most definitions con-sider that preserved cognitive functioning, functional autonomy in daily life activities, and emotional well-being are the main features of successful aging (18). In that perspective, in addition to death, dementia, depression, and disability can be viewed as the cardinal markers of successful or pathological aging. Such conditions not only have devastating effects at individuals’ level, but they also are the main sources of burden for family caregivers and—at least three of them—generate heavy costs for our societies.\\nThe present study was conducted within the PAQUID survey, a\\nprospective population-based study involving 25\\xa0years of follow-up, and consisted in assessing the relationship between hearing status and the occurrence of four major adverse events: death, dementia, depression, and disability.'), Document(page_content='Study Population and Protocol\\nThe PAQUID study is a French epidemiological study relying on a population-based sample of 3,777 community-dwelling individu-als aged 65 or older. The study has received the approval of Ethics Committee of the Bordeaux University Hospital, and all participants gave their written informed consent to participate in this study. Volunteers were evaluated at home at the initial visit (T0) and at 1 (T1), 3 (T3), 5 (T5), 8 (T8), 10 (T10), 13 (T13), 15 (T15), 17 (T17), 20 (T20), 22 (T22), and 25 (T25) years. Each visit included a neuro-psychological evaluation and a criteria checklist for dementia diag-nosis completed by a trained psychologist. At each follow-up visit, tests and scales of cognitive performances, cognitive complaints, functional abilities, and depressive symptomatology were adminis-tered to participants. A\\xa0short neuropsychological battery has been administered comprising Mini-Mental State Examination (19) pro-viding a global assessment of cognitive functioning. Full details of the study have been described elsewhere (20). Table\\xa01 displays the\\nstudy participation all along the 25\\xa0years of follow-up.Hearing Status Measures\\nAt baseline, a short questionnaire assessing self-perceived hearing problems has been administered. To the question “do you have hear -\\ning trouble?” the participant could respond as follows: (a) I\\xa0do not have hearing trouble; (b) I\\xa0have trouble following the conversation with two or more people talking at the same time or in a noisy back-ground; and (c) I\\xa0have major hearing trouble. Participants were also asked whether they used a hearing aid or not.\\nDeath\\nAt each follow-up, vital status was systematically recorded for all the participants. Data on vital status and date of death were collected from family, physicians, and civil state records.\\nDepressive Symptoms\\nDepressive symptomatology was assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (21). Participants were considered as having depressive symptomatology when the score was equal to 23 or higher for women and 17 or higher for men.\\nDisability\\nTwo domains of disability based on the concepts of basic activi-ties of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) were used as outcomes. Based on the Lawton–Brody scale (22), disability in IADL was assessed according to the ability of the participants to use a telephone, manage medication, manage money, use public or private transport, and do shopping, for both genders, and add-itionally, to do the laundry, do housework, and prepare meals for\\xa0women.\\nDisability in ADL was assessed using five items of the Katz scale\\n(23): bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring from bed to chair, and eating. Incontinence, which is an impairment rather than a disability (24), was not considered\\xa0here.\\nA participant was considered as disabled if he or she could not\\nperform at least one activity of the domain without a given level of assistance, as defined in the respective instruments (22, 23).\\nDementia Diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of dementia relied on a three-step procedure. After the interview and neuropsychological evaluation, the psychologist com-pleted a criteria checklist for dementia diagnosis. Individuals who met dementia criteria were seen by a neurologist or geriatrician who confirmed or rejected the diagnosis according to current standards. At final step, the diagnosis of dementia and its etiology was reviewed by an independent panel of specialized neurologists.\\nStudy\\xa0Sample\\nAll 3,777 participants of the PAQUID cohort were eligible for this analysis, with the exception of those with a diagnosis of dementia at baseline visit (n\\xa0=\\xa0102) and those who did not complete the ques-tionnaire on hearing problems (n\\xa0=\\xa093). Of these, 3,588 had avail-able data for the analyses on mortality and those on dementia. In addition, to study the occurrence of each outcome studied (disability in ADL, disability in ADL, and depression), we excluded the par -\\nticipants already having the condition at baseline. So, samples were as follows: 3,452 for the analyses on disability in ADL, 2,561 for the analyses on disability in IADL, and 3,119 for the analyses on depression.

In a first model, the predictor variable was hearing loss: self-reported hearing loss and no self-reported hearing loss. In additional exploratory analyses, the group of participants reporting hearing loss was stratified according to hearing-aid\\xa0use.\\nAnalyses of the risk of occurrence of the outcome variables\\nwere performed using a Cox proportional hazards model (25). The number of years since the baseline was used as the basic time scale in the analysis. For each outcome, multivariate analyses controlled for age, gender, educational level (defined in two categories: no formal education and school certificate or higher), and the number of comorbidities (including hypertension, myocardial infarction, angor, diabetes, dyspnea, history of stroke, and smoking) were performed. Interactions with gender were tested to assess whether gender modu-lated the relationship between hearing status and each of the to-be-predicted outcomes. Analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.3), Proc Phreg (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).', metadata={'Header': 'Methods'}), Document(page_content='Participants\\nMean age of the whole sample at baseline was 75.3 (SD\\xa0=\\xa06.8), 57.8 per cent were women. Table\\xa02 displays the baseline characteristics of\\nthe three subgroups of participants. At baseline, 2,299 reported no hearing trouble, 1,113 reported hearing problems not using hearing aids (of whom 49.7% were women), and 176 reported hearing prob-lems using hearing aids (of whom 44.9% were women). Significant differences between the three groups of participants were observed for all variables.\\nSelf-reported Hearing Loss and Risk of Death,\\nDepression, Disability, and Dementia\\nTable\\xa03 displays the hazard ratios (HR) estimated by multivariate\\nCox models for death, depression, disability, and dementia for the group of participants with self-reported hearing problems compared with participants reporting no hearing problems. As may be seen, after adjustment for sociodemographic and health variables, an increased risk of dementia and of disability in ADL were found in elders with self-reported hearing problems. There was a statistical trend for disability in IADL. For mortality, dementia, and disability, there was no significant interaction with gender. However, a signifi-cant interaction with gender was found for depression (p\\xa0=\\xa0.03).\\nStratified Analysis According to Hearing-Aid\\xa0Use\\nTable\\xa0 4 reports the results of additional exploratory models con-ducted after stratifying the group of participants reporting hearing loss according to hearing-aid use. No increased risk of mortality was found in elders with self-reported hearing problems whether they used hearing aids or not. Regarding depression, no increased risk was found for the group of participants reporting hearing problems (using or not using hearing aids) compared with the participants reporting no hearing problems. Due to significant interaction with gender, stratified analyses were conducted and showed that self-reported hearing problems with no hearing aids were associated with higher risk of depression in men (Table\\xa05). Regarding disability, the model showed an increased risk of disability in ADL for the group of participants with self-reported hearing problems not using hear -\\ning aids. No increased risk was found for those with self-reported hearing problems using hearing aids compared with the participants reporting no hearing problems. Actually in this group, the HR was <1 (HR\\xa0=\\xa00.81). Similarly, for disability in IADL, the model showed an increased risk for the participants with self-reported hearing problems not using hearing aids but not for those using hearing aids. Finally, regarding dementia, the model showed an increased risk for the group of participants with self-reported hearing problems not using hearing aids. No increased risk was found for those with self-reported hearing problems using hearing aids compared with the group reporting no hearing problems. Actually in this group, the HR was <1 (HR\\xa0=\\xa00.86).', metadata={'Header': 'Results'}), Document(page_content='With a design involving 25\\xa0years of follow-up of a population-based cohort of elderly participants, our study evidenced a significant asso-ciation between self-reported hearing problems and increased risk of ADL and IADL disability and dementia. It was also associated with increased risk of depression in men. Regarding mortality, similar risk of death all along the 25\\xa0years of study follow-up was found in par -\\nticipants with or without self-reported hearing problems.\\nNumerous studies had reported a negative association between\\nhearing impairment and depression and social isolation (2, 3).\\nInterestingly in our study, such a negative impact was particularly seen in men. This result could be linked to gender differences in audiometric shapes of presbyacusic individuals. Men seem to show more loss than women at frequencies above 1\\xa0kHz, whereas women show more loss below 1\\xa0 kHz probably because different factors may be involved in age-related hearing loss phenomenon in males and females (eg noise exposure and microvascular disease) (26). With high frequency loss affecting speech comprehension, the po-tential impact in daily life may be different and repercussions on communication abilities more important in men. Some studies also reported an association with disability. However, they were either cross-sectional (27, 28) or involved a very short follow-up period\\n(29). In addition to the long follow-up, our study has the advantage to measure disability in both ADL and IADL and yielded consistent results for the two domains of disability. Regarding dementia, few studies have reported an increased risk of developing dementia in\\nFigure\\xa01.  Flow of participants through study, PAQUID cohort.Journals of Gerontology: MEDICAL SCIENCES, 2018, Vol. 00, No. 00 3\\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/gerona/glx250/4783130\\nby INSERM user\\non 12 February 2018\\nolder adults with hearing impairment (9, 30, 31). Therefore, along\\nwith prior findings, our results strongly reinforce the assumption\\nthat self-reported hearing problems in elders contribute to develop depression, disability, and dementia. Regarding mortality, the litera-ture is mitigated. Some studies showed higher mortality (32), others reported no association (33), whereas others suggested an associ-ation with mortality mediated by factors such as cognitive impair -\\nment, disability, or subjective health (34). In our study, similar risk of mortality all along the 25\\xa0years of study follow-up was found in participants with or without self-reported hearing problems.\\nInterestingly, negative associations between self-reported hear -\\ning trouble and depression, disability, and dementia were not evi-denced in older adults using hearing aids. In other words, elders with self-reported hearing problems using hearing aids presented similar risk of developing depression, disability, and dementia all along the 25\\xa0years of follow-up of the study as their counterparts reporting no hearing impairment. Such a result had never been reported.Some longitudinal data have looked at the impact of hearing-aid\\nuse on health outcomes. These studies have reported positive im-pact on quality of life (11), handicap and better physical health (12), and cognitive decline (13). Scarce RCTs have looked at the impact of hearing-aid use on health. Three of them reported reductions in hearing handicap in the hearing-aid group (14–16) and one found no impact (17). As may be seen, limited information is available from longitudinal observational studies or RCTs regarding the effect of hearing aids on disability and mental health. Most of the studies to date have been limited to short-term outcomes associated with hear -\\ning-aid use. Yet, one would expect that the positive impact of hear -\\ning-aid use may only emerge after a longer time frame. Cognitive decline, disability, and dementia are slowly progressive phenomena that can only be captured over a time scale of several years. Some protective effects of hearing-aid use may therefore only be observ-able over a time scale of years or decades and may be missed by RCTs or short prospective observational studies.T able\\xa02.

Another strength is the population-based design, and the interviews that were con-ducted in participants’ homes, facilitating the participation of frailer older people. However, to be included in the study, participants were required to be able to communicate during the home interview. This criterion probably decreased the number of persons with severe hearing impairment. Moreover, multiple factors may affect whether an individual with hearing loss uses or not hearing aids such as income, health awareness, or personality traits. Even though numer -\\nous potentially confounding variables have been controlled for in our study, obviously we cannot exclude residual effects of uncon-trolled variables. In particular, the question of what differs in people who use hearing aids compared with those who do not is a critical but complex issue. Further studies should try to better character -\\nize what makes people with hearing loss seek for care and whether such characteristics can explain at least partially the potential ben-efits of hearing-aid use. As recommended by previous studies having validated the CESD-scale in French elderly population (35), we used different cut-points for men and women. This could have potential implications on the interpretation of results related to depression outcome. Another limitation of our study relies on the self-reported measure of hearing impairment. Hearing status and hearing-aid use could have changed all along the follow-up period. In addition, no audiometric measure is available. Our measure simply consisted in collecting self-perceived hearing difficulty which is far less precise than an audiometric measure. Nonetheless, numerous studies have shown that self-reported hearing loss is highly correlated to audio-metric measures of hearing loss in older adults (36–41). In addition, from a practical point of view, in a perspective of screening for hear -\\ning loss in elderly persons and its potential consequences, such an easy-to-collect measure may be useful.\\nOur study shows that self-reported hearing trouble is associated\\nwith increased risk of disability, dementia, and also depression in men.

Thus, assess-\\ning the impact of hearing loss with and without management on health outcomes is a matter of major importance to elderly individu-als and the field of public health. Healthy aging embraces cognitive, physical, and emotional dimensions. Indeed, most definitions con-sider that preserved cognitive functioning, functional autonomy in daily life activities, and emotional well-being are the main features of successful aging (18). In that perspective, in addition to death, dementia, depression, and disability can be viewed as the cardinal markers of successful or pathological aging. Such conditions not only have devastating effects at individuals’ level, but they also are the main sources of burden for family caregivers and—at least three of them—generate heavy costs for our societies.\\nThe present study was conducted within the PAQUID survey, a\\nprospective population-based study involving 25\\xa0years of follow-up, and consisted in assessing the relationship between hearing status and the occurrence of four major adverse events: death, dementia, depression, and disability.', metadata={'source': './articles/0dacb0b566cb38438b84aa092176c6d42bf4402d.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Study Population and Protocol\\nThe PAQUID study is a French epidemiological study relying on a population-based sample of 3,777 community-dwelling individu-als aged 65 or older. The study has received the approval of Ethics Committee of the Bordeaux University Hospital, and all participants gave their written informed consent to participate in this study. Volunteers were evaluated at home at the initial visit (T0) and at 1 (T1), 3 (T3), 5 (T5), 8 (T8), 10 (T10), 13 (T13), 15 (T15), 17 (T17), 20 (T20), 22 (T22), and 25 (T25) years. Each visit included a neuro-psychological evaluation and a criteria checklist for dementia diag-nosis completed by a trained psychologist. At each follow-up visit, tests and scales of cognitive performances, cognitive complaints, functional abilities, and depressive symptomatology were adminis-tered to participants. A\\xa0short neuropsychological battery has been administered comprising Mini-Mental State Examination (19) pro-viding a global assessment of cognitive functioning. Full details of the study have been described elsewhere (20). Table\\xa01 displays the\\nstudy participation all along the 25\\xa0years of follow-up.Hearing Status Measures\\nAt baseline, a short questionnaire assessing self-perceived hearing problems has been administered. To the question “do you have hear -\\ning trouble?” the participant could respond as follows: (a) I\\xa0do not have hearing trouble; (b) I\\xa0have trouble following the conversation with two or more people talking at the same time or in a noisy back-ground; and (c) I\\xa0have major hearing trouble. Participants were also asked whether they used a hearing aid or not.\\nDeath\\nAt each follow-up, vital status was systematically recorded for all the participants. Data on vital status and date of death were collected from family, physicians, and civil state records.\\nDepressive Symptoms\\nDepressive symptomatology was assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (21). Participants were considered as having depressive symptomatology when the score was equal to 23 or higher for women and 17 or higher for men.\\nDisability\\nTwo domains of disability based on the concepts of basic activi-ties of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) were used as outcomes. Based on the Lawton–Brody scale (22), disability in IADL was assessed according to the ability of the participants to use a telephone, manage medication, manage money, use public or private transport, and do shopping, for both genders, and add-itionally, to do the laundry, do housework, and prepare meals for\\xa0women.\\nDisability in ADL was assessed using five items of the Katz scale\\n(23): bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring from bed to chair, and eating. Incontinence, which is an impairment rather than a disability (24), was not considered\\xa0here.\\nA participant was considered as disabled if he or she could not\\nperform at least one activity of the domain without a given level of assistance, as defined in the respective instruments (22, 23).\\nDementia Diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of dementia relied on a three-step procedure. After the interview and neuropsychological evaluation, the psychologist com-pleted a criteria checklist for dementia diagnosis. Individuals who met dementia criteria were seen by a neurologist or geriatrician who confirmed or rejected the diagnosis according to current standards. At final step, the diagnosis of dementia and its etiology was reviewed by an independent panel of specialized neurologists.\\nStudy\\xa0Sample\\nAll 3,777 participants of the PAQUID cohort were eligible for this analysis, with the exception of those with a diagnosis of dementia at baseline visit (n\\xa0=\\xa0102) and those who did not complete the ques-tionnaire on hearing problems (n\\xa0=\\xa093). Of these, 3,588 had avail-able data for the analyses on mortality and those on dementia. In addition, to study the occurrence of each outcome studied (disability in ADL, disability in ADL, and depression), we excluded the par -\\nticipants already having the condition at baseline. So, samples were as follows: 3,452 for the analyses on disability in ADL, 2,561 for the analyses on disability in IADL, and 3,119 for the analyses on depression.

In additional exploratory analyses, the group of participants reporting hearing loss was stratified according to hearing-aid\\xa0use.\\nAnalyses of the risk of occurrence of the outcome variables\\nwere performed using a Cox proportional hazards model (25). The number of years since the baseline was used as the basic time scale in the analysis. For each outcome, multivariate analyses controlled for age, gender, educational level (defined in two categories: no formal education and school certificate or higher), and the number of comorbidities (including hypertension, myocardial infarction, angor, diabetes, dyspnea, history of stroke, and smoking) were performed. Interactions with gender were tested to assess whether gender modu-lated the relationship between hearing status and each of the to-be-predicted outcomes.

As may be seen, after adjustment for sociodemographic and health variables, an increased risk of dementia and of disability in ADL were found in elders with self-reported hearing problems. There was a statistical trend for disability in IADL. For mortality, dementia, and disability, there was no significant interaction with gender.

No increased risk of mortality was found in elders with self-reported hearing problems whether they used hearing aids or not. Regarding depression, no increased risk was found for the group of participants reporting hearing problems (using or not using hearing aids) compared with the participants reporting no hearing problems. Due to significant interaction with gender, stratified analyses were conducted and showed that self-reported hearing problems with no hearing aids were associated with higher risk of depression in men (Table\\xa05). Regarding disability, the model showed an increased risk of disability in ADL for the group of participants with self-reported hearing problems not using hear -\\ning aids. No increased risk was found for those with self-reported hearing problems using hearing aids compared with the participants reporting no hearing problems. Actually in this group, the HR was <1 (HR\\xa0=\\xa00.81). Similarly, for disability in IADL, the model showed an increased risk for the participants with self-reported hearing problems not using hearing aids but not for those using hearing aids. Finally, regarding dementia, the model showed an increased risk for the group of participants with self-reported hearing problems not using hearing aids.

It was also associated with increased risk of depression in men. Regarding mortality, similar risk of death all along the 25\\xa0years of study follow-up was found in par -\\nticipants with or without self-reported hearing problems.\\nNumerous studies had reported a negative association between\\nhearing impairment and depression and social isolation (2, 3).\\nInterestingly in our study, such a negative impact was particularly seen in men. This result could be linked to gender differences in audiometric shapes of presbyacusic individuals. Men seem to show more loss than women at frequencies above 1\\xa0kHz, whereas women show more loss below 1\\xa0 kHz probably because different factors may be involved in age-related hearing loss phenomenon in males and females (eg noise exposure and microvascular disease) (26). With high frequency loss affecting speech comprehension, the po-tential impact in daily life may be different and repercussions on communication abilities more important in men. Some studies also reported an association with disability. However, they were either cross-sectional (27, 28) or involved a very short follow-up period\\n(29). In addition to the long follow-up, our study has the advantage to measure disability in both ADL and IADL and yielded consistent results for the two domains of disability. Regarding dementia, few studies have reported an increased risk of developing dementia in\\nFigure\\xa01.

Therefore, along\\nwith prior findings, our results strongly reinforce the assumption\\nthat self-reported hearing problems in elders contribute to develop depression, disability, and dementia. Regarding mortality, the litera-ture is mitigated. Some studies showed higher mortality (32), others reported no association (33), whereas others suggested an associ-ation with mortality mediated by factors such as cognitive impair -\\nment, disability, or subjective health (34). In our study, similar risk of mortality all along the 25\\xa0years of study follow-up was found in participants with or without self-reported hearing problems.\\nInterestingly, negative associations between self-reported hear -\\ning trouble and depression, disability, and dementia were not evi-denced in older adults using hearing aids. In other words, elders with self-reported hearing problems using hearing aids presented similar risk of developing depression, disability, and dementia all along the 25\\xa0years of follow-up of the study as their counterparts reporting no hearing impairment. Such a result had never been reported.Some longitudinal data have looked at the impact of hearing-aid\\nuse on health outcomes. These studies have reported positive im-pact on quality of life (11), handicap and better physical health (12), and cognitive decline (13). Scarce RCTs have looked at the impact of hearing-aid use on health. Three of them reported reductions in hearing handicap in the hearing-aid group (14–16) and one found no impact (17). As may be seen, limited information is available from longitudinal observational studies or RCTs regarding the effect of hearing aids on disability and mental health. Most of the studies to date have been limited to short-term outcomes associated with hear -\\ning-aid use. Yet, one would expect that the positive impact of hear -\\ning-aid use may only emerge after a longer time frame. Cognitive decline, disability, and dementia are slowly progressive phenomena that can only be captured over a time scale of several years. Some protective effects of hearing-aid use may therefore only be observ-able over a time scale of years or decades and may be missed by RCTs or short prospective observational studies.T able\\xa02.

Another strength is the population-based design, and the interviews that were con-ducted in participants’ homes, facilitating the participation of frailer older people. However, to be included in the study, participants were required to be able to communicate during the home interview. This criterion probably decreased the number of persons with severe hearing impairment. Moreover, multiple factors may affect whether an individual with hearing loss uses or not hearing aids such as income, health awareness, or personality traits. Even though numer -\\nous potentially confounding variables have been controlled for in our study, obviously we cannot exclude residual effects of uncon-trolled variables. In particular, the question of what differs in people who use hearing aids compared with those who do not is a critical but complex issue. Further studies should try to better character -\\nize what makes people with hearing loss seek for care and whether such characteristics can explain at least partially the potential ben-efits of hearing-aid use. As recommended by previous studies having validated the CESD-scale in French elderly population (35), we used different cut-points for men and women. This could have potential implications on the interpretation of results related to depression outcome. Another limitation of our study relies on the self-reported measure of hearing impairment. Hearing status and hearing-aid use could have changed all along the follow-up period. In addition, no audiometric measure is available. Our measure simply consisted in collecting self-perceived hearing difficulty which is far less precise than an audiometric measure. Nonetheless, numerous studies have shown that self-reported hearing loss is highly correlated to audio-metric measures of hearing loss in older adults (36–41). In addition, from a practical point of view, in a perspective of screening for hear -\\ning loss in elderly persons and its potential consequences, such an easy-to-collect measure may be useful.\\nOur study shows that self-reported hearing trouble is associated\\nwith increased risk of disability, dementia, and also depression in men. Such increased risks were not evidenced in those older adults using hearing aids. Because hearing impairment in older adults is T able\\xa04.
